# Next Steps - Life Story
Last Updated: February 6, 2026

## Immediate Tasks (Start Here)

### 1. Heat Map Visualization
**Priority**: HIGH
**File(s)**: New component, likely using D3.js or Chart.js
**What to do**: Visualize birthday popularity data as a calendar heat map (365 days, colored by frequency)
**Why**: Listed as priority #1 in CLAUDE.md
**Estimated effort**: Substantial

### 2. Case File Theme Redesign
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**File(s)**: `src/components/themes/CaseFileTheme.jsx`
**What to do**: Redesign or rethink the case file theme — currently feels cheesy (#66)
**Why**: Open issue #66
**Estimated effort**: Substantial

## Future Enhancements

- Additional themes
- Social sharing (Open Graph meta tags per report)

## Questions to Resolve

- Should the FAB be hidden on the landing page? (Currently shows but has no birthday context)
- Heat map: D3.js calendar heatmap vs custom SVG?

## Blockers

- None
