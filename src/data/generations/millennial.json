      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996. That's Pew Research's definition, which became the standard after years of people arguing about who counts. Your generation is roughly 72 million people in the US, which made you the largest cohort until Gen Z started catching up.</p><p>The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. You were {{AGE_AT_911}}. Old enough to understand what was happening, young enough for it to fundamentally shape your worldview. The pre-9/11 world feels like a different country. Post-9/11, everything was security theater and fear.</p><p>Your generation graduated into the 2008 financial crisis, watched housing prices triple while wages stayed flat, and somehow got blamed for killing everything from chain restaurants to the concept of home ownership. You didn't invent avocado toast—you invented the phrase 'I can't afford a house' as a personality trait.</p><p>Millennials are sandwiched between Gen X (who got theirs before the economy collapsed) and Gen Z (who never expected to get anything in the first place). You're optimistic enough to believe things could get better, cynical enough to know they probably won't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that invented modern dating app culture, which is less an invention and more a slow-motion car crash you all witnessed from inside the vehicle. Tinder launched when you were in your twenties or thirties. You watched courtship become a swipe-based sorting algorithm.</p><p>You probably met at least one partner online, which your grandparents find baffling and your Gen Z cousins find completely normal. You're the bridge generation—old enough to remember meeting people in person, young enough to have normalized meeting them on screens.</p><p>You communicate primarily through text, but you remember calling people on actual phones. You know the anxiety of waiting for someone to respond, and you know the different anxieties that come with read receipts. You've had entire relationships happen via DM.</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage longer than any previous generation. Not because you don't want partnerships, but because weddings are expensive, houses are expensive, kids are expensive, and your student loans are crushing. The life script your parents followed isn't available at a price you can afford.</p><p>You've normalized long-distance relationships because you've all moved for work, for school, for cheaper rent. You've maintained friendships across time zones via group chats. You know how to be close to people who are far away and distant from people who are near.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest weakness is the same as its biggest strength: you believe you can optimize everything. You track your sleep, your steps, your macros, your screen time. You approach self-improvement like it's a productivity hack. The problem is you can't gamify your way out of systemic problems.</p><p>You're so good at adapting to broken systems that you sometimes forget to question whether the systems should exist at all. You've normalized precarity. You've accepted that healthcare is tied to employment, that education requires debt, that retirement is a fantasy. You've learned to cope instead of demanding change.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that don't serve you. You've been trained to be team players, to not rock the boat, to bring solutions not problems. This makes you easy to exploit. You'll work unpaid overtime for 'exposure.' You'll accept 'equity' instead of salary. You'll endure toxic workplaces because the job market is brutal and you need health insurance.</p><p>You're so steeped in irony and self-deprecation that earnestness feels dangerous. You can't just like something—you have to like it ironically, or like it despite its flaws, or explain why liking it is actually a critique. This makes it hard to advocate for yourself without hedging, apologizing, or making it a joke.</p><p>Your generation is so online that you sometimes forget offline life is where the actual stakes are. You can mobilize for causes on social media, but voter turnout lags. You can cancel celebrities, but changing policy requires showing up to boring city council meetings. The digital activism feels like action, but it's often just performance.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people born in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. The entire Millennial generation is about 72 million people in the US, making it the largest generation until Gen Z overtakes it sometime in the next decade.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more educated, more diverse, and significantly poorer. Gen X inherited a functioning economy and broke it before passing it to you. They got affordable college. You got student loans. They got pensions. You got 401(k)s. They got stability. You got the gig economy.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the wealth gap is staggering. Boomers controlled 21% of the nation's wealth when they were your age. Millennials control 7%. Boomers bought houses for a year's salary. You're spending a year's salary on rent. Boomers retired with pensions. You're hoping Social Security still exists when you're 70.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're similar but slightly more optimistic. You remember a time before everything was terrible. Gen Z doesn't. You believed the system could be fixed. Gen Z knows it's broken and is building alternatives. You adapted to smartphones. They were born with them. You're the last generation to remember the before times.</p><p>Your life expectancy is 78-80 years, which is slightly lower than previous generations due to rising rates of 'deaths of despair'—suicide, drugs, alcohol. Your generation has worse mental health outcomes than any before. You're more anxious, more depressed, more medicated. The world you inherited is harder, lonelier, and more expensive than the one promised to you.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more educated, and more aware of systemic injustice than any generation before. You've normalized therapy, destigmatized mental health, and pushed for equity in ways your parents' generation didn't. You've made the world more inclusive even as it's become less affordable. That's not nothing.</p>"
