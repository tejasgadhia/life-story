      "html": "<h2>The Millennial Generation</h2><p>Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996. That's Pew Research's definition, which became the standard after years of debate about who counts. This generation numbers roughly 72 million Americans, making it the largest cohort until Gen Z started catching up.</p><p>The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. Members of this generation were {{AGE_AT_911}} that day. Old enough to understand what was happening, young enough for it to fundamentally shape their worldview. The pre-9/11 world feels like a different country. Post-9/11, everything was security theater and fear.</p><p>Millennials graduated into the 2008 financial crisis, watched housing prices triple while wages stayed flat, and somehow got blamed for killing everything from chain restaurants to the concept of home ownership. The generation didn't invent avocado toast—it invented 'I can't afford a house' as a personality trait.</p><p>Millennials are sandwiched between Gen X (who entered the housing market before prices went vertical) and Gen Z (who never expected to enter it at all). This generation is optimistic enough to believe things could improve, cynical enough to see the reasons they might not.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>The generation that invented modern dating app culture, which is less an invention and more a slow-motion experiment the whole cohort witnessed from inside. Tinder launched when Millennials were in their twenties or thirties. Courtship became a swipe-based sorting algorithm.</p><p>This is the bridge generation in dating—old enough to remember meeting people in person, young enough to have normalized meeting them on screens. At least one partner was probably met online, which grandparents find baffling and Gen Z cousins find completely ordinary.</p><p>Millennials communicate primarily through text but remember calling people on actual phones. The anxiety of waiting for someone to respond is familiar territory, as are the different anxieties that come with read receipts. Entire relationships have happened via DM.</p><p>This generation delayed marriage longer than any previous one. Not from lack of interest in partnership, but because weddings are expensive, houses are expensive, kids are expensive, and student loans are substantial. The life script previous generations followed isn't available at the same price point.</p><p>Millennials have normalized long-distance relationships because the generation has scattered—for work, for school, for more affordable rent. Friendships are maintained across time zones via group chats that have been active for a decade. Closeness to people who are far away became a practiced skill; distance from people who are nearby, an occasional side effect.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's biggest blind spot is the same as its biggest strength: the belief that everything can be optimized. Sleep tracking, step counting, macro monitoring, screen time limits. Self-improvement gets approached like a productivity hack. The problem is that systemic issues don't respond to individual optimization.</p><p>Millennials are so good at adapting to broken systems that the systems themselves sometimes go unquestioned. Healthcare tied to employment, education requiring debt, retirement as an uncertain proposition—these have been absorbed as background conditions rather than examined as policy choices. Coping skills are impressive; the question is whether they've replaced the instinct to push for structural change.</p><p>There's a conflict-averse streak that doesn't always serve this generation well. Trained to be team players, to not rock the boat, to bring solutions not problems. This makes the cohort easy to take advantage of in workplace settings—accepting 'equity' instead of salary, enduring difficult conditions because the job market is tight and health insurance is non-negotiable.</p><p>Millennials are so steeped in irony and self-deprecation that earnestness can feel risky. Liking something requires liking it ironically, or despite its flaws, or with a disclaimer. This makes self-advocacy harder—everything gets hedged, qualified, turned into a joke. Sincerity is the scariest form of vulnerability.</p><p>This generation is deeply online, which sometimes creates a gap between digital engagement and real-world action. Social media mobilization is impressive, but voter turnout in local elections—where policy actually changes—has historically lagged behind post counts. Canceling celebrities is easier than changing zoning laws. Digital activism feels like action, but the stakes live offline.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>A birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people were born in the US in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. The entire Millennial generation is about 72 million Americans, the largest living generation—at least for now. Gen Z is catching up.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Millennials earned the same degrees, but Gen X entered a job market that paid enough to live on. Gen Xers bought houses in their twenties; many Millennials are still renting in their thirties. Gen X had pensions; Millennials have 401(k)s and the uncertain hope that Social Security holds. Gen X came of age during economic expansion; Millennials came of age during economic contraction. The difference isn't work ethic—it's timing.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> The wealth gap is the headline number. When Boomers were the same age, they controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials control 7%. Boomers bought their forever home at 28 on a single income; Millennials in their thirties with two incomes are often still renting. Boomer home values appreciated 400% over decades—wealth accumulation that happened largely while they slept.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Millennials remember the before times. Gen Z doesn't. Millennials still believe, somewhere deep down, that the system can be reformed. Gen Z sees it as broken and is building around it. Millennials adapted to smartphones as teenagers; Gen Z was born with them. Millennials have nostalgia; Gen Z has pragmatism.</p><p>Life expectancy for this cohort is 78-80 years—slightly lower than previous generations, reflecting broader trends in mental health challenges and substance-related issues. Millennials report higher rates of anxiety and depression than prior cohorts, which increasingly gets treated as a public health pattern rather than an individual failing.</p><p>But this generation has also made the world measurably better. Millennials normalized therapy, destigmatized mental health struggles, and pushed for marriage equality and racial justice in ways previous generations hadn't. The economy is tougher, but the culture shifted because this generation showed up. That matters.</p>"
