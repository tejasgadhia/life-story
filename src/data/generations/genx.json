      "html": "<h2>The Gen X Generation</h2><p>Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. At roughly 65 million Americans, this is the smallest generation of the 20th century—sandwiched between the massive Boomer cohort and the even larger Millennial wave. Gen X has spent its entire existence being overlooked, which suits most of them fine. Being ignored means being left alone.</p><p>The defining moment was more of a defining absence: the adults weren't paying attention. These were the original latchkey kids. Their parents divorced at record rates. They came home to empty houses and raised themselves on MTV and microwave dinners. Independence wasn't a cultivated virtue—it was a survival skill.</p><p>Gen X came of age during economic malaise (the early '80s recession), the Cold War's final gasp, and the AIDS crisis. This cohort watched the Challenger explode on live TV, saw the Berlin Wall fall, and was old enough to remember a world before personal computers yet young enough to adapt when they took over.</p><p>Gen X is defined by skepticism. This generation doesn't trust institutions, corporations, or politicians—and for good reason. Watergate's aftermath, the savings and loan crisis, Enron, the 2008 collapse: every authority figure who asked for trust eventually proved unworthy of it. The cynicism isn't a pose; it's earned.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Gen X bridged analog and digital dating. This generation met people at bars, at concerts, through friends—the old-fashioned way. But they were also young enough when the internet arrived to try early dating sites, awkward as they were. Match.com launched in 1995, when Gen Xers were somewhere between 15 and 30.</p><p>This generation delayed marriage compared to Boomers, but not as dramatically as Millennials would. Gen Xers got married, had kids, got divorced at rates nearly as high as their parents—then sometimes did it all again. The nuclear family ideal the Boomers sold turned out to be more fragile than advertised.</p><p>Communication-wise, Gen X is bilingual. Formal letters and text messages come with equal facility. This is the generation that remembers when long-distance calls cost money, when answering machines were cutting-edge, when email was new and exciting. Communication evolved from deliberate to instantaneous, and the jury's still out on whether that's an improvement.</p><p>Gen Xers maintain friendships through a mix of methods: occasional texts, less occasional phone calls, annual reunions that feel like no time has passed. Less perpetually connected than younger generations, and generally preferring it that way. Quality over quantity, depth over breadth.</p><p>This generation pioneered the work-life balance conversation, mostly from watching Boomer parents sacrifice everything for careers that eventually discarded them. Gen Xers are less likely to be defined by their jobs, more likely to prioritize time with family—lessons learned from watching the previous generation get it wrong.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's biggest blind spot is mistaking disengagement for wisdom. Gen X is so proud of not caring that it sometimes fails to show up when it matters. Voter turnout has historically lagged. Political engagement often stops at ironic detachment. 'Whatever' is a coping mechanism, not a philosophy.</p><p>There's an internalized belief that nothing ever really changes, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when the people who believe it opt out of trying. The skepticism, while often warranted, can curdle into apathy. The system has problems, sure—but sitting out the game doesn't fix them.</p><p>Gen X tends to assume younger generations are soft because they expect more from institutions. But expecting healthcare to be affordable isn't soft—it's rational. Expecting workplaces to not be toxic isn't entitled—it's reasonable. The ability to endure dysfunction isn't inherently a virtue; sometimes it's just a habit formed under pressure.</p><p>There's a tendency to romanticize unsupervised childhoods as character-building when they were often just neglect with better optics. Many turned out fine, and the hands-off parenting of the '70s and '80s built genuine resilience. But plenty of people didn't turn out fine, and nostalgia shouldn't paper over that reality.</p><p>Gen X is the forgotten middle child of generations, and sometimes wields that invisibility as a shield. But being overlooked isn't the same as being irrelevant. This generation has influence it isn't fully using, institutional power it isn't fully exercising, and a perspective—bridging analog and digital, skepticism and pragmatism—that's genuinely valuable.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>A birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people were born in the US in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. Generation X as a whole numbers about 65 million Americans—significantly smaller than Boomers before or Millennials after.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), Gen X got a later start economically. Boomers bought houses when they were affordable, had pensions, and entered a job market that rewarded loyalty. By the time Gen X arrived, the party was winding down—the tail end of good times meeting the beginning of structural economic shifts. Gen X adapted; there wasn't another option.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), Gen X is more self-reliant and less collaborative. Millennials grew up with helicopter parents tracking their every move; Gen X grew up with latchkey freedom and benign neglect. Millennials expect institutions to function; Gen X expects them to disappoint. Gen X holds more wealth than Millennials, though less than Boomers—the perpetual middle children of the economic hierarchy.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), Gen X is practically from another era. Gen Z has never known a world without internet, smartphones, or social media. Gen X remembers all of it arriving, changing everything, making the world unrecognizable. That gives Gen X a perspective on technological change that younger generations lack—and a certain weariness that comes with having watched it all unfold.</p><p>Life expectancy for Gen X sits slightly lower than Boomers, influenced in part by rising rates of substance-related health issues and mental health challenges that accelerated in middle age. The 'forgotten generation' label has some difficult truths behind it.</p><p>What Gen X did right: this generation raised children more intentionally than they were raised. The attentive parenting that emerged was partly a reaction to their own latchkey childhoods. Gen Xers showed up for their kids in ways their parents didn't show up for them. That's a meaningful legacy—quiet, practical, and entirely on-brand.</p>"
