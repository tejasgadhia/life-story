      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Generation X</h2><p>You're Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. At roughly 65 million Americans, you're the smallest generation of the 20th century—sandwiched between the massive Boomer cohort and the even larger Millennial wave. You've spent your entire life being overlooked, which suits you fine. Being ignored means being left alone.</p><p>Your defining moment was more of a defining absence: the adults weren't paying attention. You were the original latchkey kids. Your parents divorced at record rates. You came home to empty houses and raised yourselves on MTV and microwave dinners. Independence wasn't a virtue you cultivated—it was a survival skill.</p><p>You came of age during economic malaise (the early '80s recession), the Cold War's final gasp, and the AIDS crisis. You watched the Challenger explode on live TV. You saw the Berlin Wall fall. You were old enough to remember a world before personal computers and young enough to adapt when they took over.</p><p>Gen X is defined by skepticism. You don't trust institutions, corporations, or politicians—and for good reason. You watched Watergate's aftermath, the savings and loan crisis, Enron, and the 2008 collapse. Every authority figure who asked for your trust eventually proved unworthy of it. Your cynicism isn't a pose; it's earned.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that bridged analog and digital dating. You met people at bars, at concerts, through friends—the old-fashioned way. But you were also young enough when the internet arrived to try early dating sites, awkward as they were. Match.com launched in 1995, when you were somewhere between 15 and 30.</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage compared to Boomers, but not as dramatically as Millennials would. You got married, had kids, got divorced at rates nearly as high as your parents—then sometimes did it all again. The nuclear family ideal your parents sold you turned out to be more fragile than advertised.</p><p>Communication-wise, you're bilingual. You can write a formal letter and a text message with equal facility. You remember when long-distance calls cost money, when answering machines were cutting-edge, when email was new and exciting. You've watched communication evolve from deliberate to instantaneous, and you're not sure it's an improvement.</p><p>You maintain friendships through a mix of methods: occasional texts, less occasional phone calls, annual reunions that feel like no time has passed. You're not as perpetually connected as younger generations, and you prefer it that way. You value quality over quantity, depth over breadth.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the work-life balance conversation, mostly because you watched your Boomer parents sacrifice everything for careers that eventually discarded them. You're less likely to be defined by your job, more likely to prioritize time with family—lessons learned from watching your parents get it wrong.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is mistaking disengagement for wisdom. You're so proud of not caring that you sometimes fail to show up when it matters. Your voter turnout has historically lagged. Your political engagement often stops at ironic detachment. 'Whatever' is a coping mechanism, not a philosophy.</p><p>You've internalized the idea that nothing ever really changes, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when you opt out of trying to change things. Your skepticism, while often warranted, can curdle into apathy. The system is rigged, sure—but sitting out the game doesn't un-rig it.</p><p>You tend to assume younger generations are soft because they expect more from institutions. But expecting healthcare to be affordable isn't soft—it's rational. Expecting workplaces to not be toxic isn't entitled—it's reasonable. Your ability to endure dysfunction isn't a virtue; it's trauma masquerading as resilience.</p><p>There's a tendency to romanticize your unsupervised childhoods as character-building when they were often just neglect with better optics. You turned out fine, so you assume the neglect was good for you. But plenty of people didn't turn out fine, and the hands-off parenting of the '70s and '80s left scars that don't show up in nostalgic memes about riding bikes without helmets.</p><p>You're the forgotten middle child of generations, and sometimes you wield that invisibility as a shield. But being overlooked isn't the same as being irrelevant. You have influence you're not using, power you're not exercising, a voice you're not raising. The kids aren't alright, and neither are the adults. Someone needs to step up.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people born in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. Generation X as a whole numbers about 65 million Americans—significantly smaller than Boomers before you or Millennials after.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), you got a rawer deal. They bought houses when they were cheap. They had pensions. They entered a job market that rewarded loyalty. By the time you arrived, the party was winding down. You got the tail end of good times and the beginning of precarity. You adapted; you had no choice.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're more cynical but less anxious. You expected less, so you're less disappointed. They were promised the world and given debt; you were promised nothing and got roughly that. You own more wealth than they do, though less than Boomers—the perpetual middle children of the economic hierarchy.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're practically ancient. They've never known a world without internet, without smartphones, without social media. You remember all of it arriving, changing everything, making the world unrecognizable. That gives you perspective they lack—and a weariness they don't yet understand.</p><p>Your life expectancy is slightly lower than Boomers, partly due to the 'deaths of despair' trend that hits your generation hard—the opioid crisis, alcohol-related deaths, and suicide rates that started climbing when you hit middle age. The American Dream's broken promises don't just create disappointment; they create casualties.</p><p>What you've done right: you raised children more intentionally than you were raised. Helicopter parenting emerged partly as a reaction to your own latchkey childhoods. You showed up for your kids in ways your parents didn't show up for you. That's not nothing. That might be everything.</p>"
