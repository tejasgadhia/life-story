      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the post-WWII birth spike that produced roughly 76 million Americans—the largest generation until Millennials came along decades later. For most of the late 20th century, Boomers were the demographic that mattered most to marketers, politicians, and cultural tastemakers.</p><p>The defining moments were plural: the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, Woodstock, Vietnam, Watergate. This generation lived through more seismic cultural shifts than any American cohort since the one that fought the Civil War. Raised by parents who survived the Depression and won World War II, Boomers inherited both security and enormous expectations.</p><p>This is the generation that invented youth culture, then spent decades refusing to age out of it. Boomers turned 'teenager' into a consumer demographic, made rock and roll mainstream, protested a war, demanded civil rights—and then, somewhere along the way, many became the establishment they once raged against.</p><p>Boomers are defined by contradictions. The generation that championed free love now clutches pearls at what's on TV. The generation that protested Vietnam supported Iraq. The generation that benefited from affordable college votes against student loan relief. Whether this is hypocrisy or simply the way people change with age is a debate that will outlive all of them.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Boomers came of age when dating meant actually going places together. People met at school, at work, at church, at parties. There were no apps, no algorithms, no swiping. Courtship required working up the nerve to approach someone, and they had to be physically present when it happened.</p><p>This generation married younger than the ones that followed. The median age at first marriage in the 1960s and '70s was around 21 for women and 23 for men—numbers that sound impossibly young to their grandchildren. The expectation was house, spouse, and kids by 30.</p><p>Communication meant phone calls on landlines, handwritten letters, and in-person conversations. Long-distance relationships were expensive—literally, by the minute. No texting, no email until midlife. Picking up the phone and actually talking to people built communication skills that younger generations sometimes struggle to replicate.</p><p>This generation also normalized divorce in ways previous generations hadn't. The divorce rate peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when many Boomers were starting families. Marriage evolved from economic necessity to personal choice, from 'til death do us part' to 'until we grow apart.'</p><p>Later life brought entirely new ways of communicating. Email, texting, video calls, social media—technologies that didn't exist when Boomers were raising kids are now essential for staying connected to grandchildren who communicate primarily through screens.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>The Boomer cohort's biggest blind spot is the assumption that what worked for them should work for everyone. They bought houses when they cost two years' salary. They paid for college with summer jobs. The economy they entered was designed to create middle-class stability. That economy no longer exists, but the lectures about bootstraps continue.</p><p>There's a tendency to underestimate how much the ground has shifted. 'Just walk in and ask for a job' is advice from 1975. Suggesting a 'starter home' doesn't account for the fact that starter homes in many markets cost $500,000. The experience, while real, is increasingly irrelevant as a roadmap for younger generations.</p><p>Boomers accumulated unprecedented wealth, and much of it came from timing. They bought assets before they became unaffordable, and benefited from policies—pensions, Social Security, affordable higher education—that subsequent generations haven't received at the same scale. This isn't necessarily malicious, but it is a pattern worth acknowledging.</p><p>There's also a tendency to dismiss systemic economic shifts as individual failures. If younger people are struggling, it must be the spending habits, the unwillingness to sacrifice, the entitlement. The possibility that the system itself has changed—that hard work no longer guarantees the same stability—is difficult to accept when hard work paid off so well for this particular cohort.</p><p>Technology is another blind spot. Boomers have adapted remarkably well in many ways, but there's a gap between using technology and understanding how it's reshaping society, politics, and information itself. The misinformation ecosystem that thrives on social media targets this demographic with particular effectiveness.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>A birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people were born in the US in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. Baby Boomers as a whole number about 76 million Americans, though that number shrinks each year as the generation ages.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), Boomers were rebels. The Silent Generation followed rules; Boomers broke them. They saved; Boomers spent. They trusted institutions; Boomers questioned everything—at least in their youth. The Silent Generation was shaped by scarcity; Boomers were shaped by abundance.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), Boomers had an easier economic on-ramp but navigated different social pressures. Boomers faced the draft; Gen X didn't. Boomers built careers at companies that offered pensions and stability; Gen X entered the workforce as those guarantees disappeared. Gen X is the middle child of generational history—too small to dominate culture, too self-reliant to ask for attention.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996) and Gen Z (born 1997-2012), the wealth gap is the headline statistic. Boomers control over 50% of U.S. wealth despite being less than 25% of the adult population. They bought houses that appreciated 400%. They received the last generation of pensions. They'll collect Social Security at levels that may not exist for their grandchildren. Boomers didn't design the system—but the timing worked enormously in their favor.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth for this cohort was around 68-70 years. Thanks to medical advances, most have exceeded that by a decade or more. This is the healthiest, longest-lived generation of retirees in human history—spending more years in retirement than their parents spent in adulthood.</p><p>What Boomers did right: they normalized social change. Civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights—these movements gained decisive momentum because this generation forced the conversation. They made the world more tolerant, more inclusive, more open. That's a legacy worth claiming.</p>"
