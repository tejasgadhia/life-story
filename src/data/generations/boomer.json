      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the post-WWII birth spike that produced roughly 76 million Americans—the largest generation until Millennials came along decades later. For most of your life, you were the demographic that mattered most to marketers, politicians, and cultural tastemakers.</p><p>Your defining moments were plural: the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, Woodstock, Vietnam, Watergate. You lived through more seismic cultural shifts than any American generation since the one that fought the Civil War. You were raised by parents who survived the Depression and won World War II, which gave you both security and enormous expectations.</p><p>Your generation invented youth culture, then spent decades refusing to age out of it. You turned 'teenager' into a consumer demographic. You made rock and roll mainstream. You protested a war, demanded civil rights, and then—somewhere along the way—many of you became the establishment you once raged against.</p><p>Boomers are defined by contradictions. The generation that championed free love now clutches pearls at what's on TV. The generation that protested Vietnam supported Iraq. The generation that benefited from affordable college votes against student loan relief. Whether this is hypocrisy or simply the way people change with age is a debate that will outlive you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age when dating meant actually going places together. You met people at school, at work, at church, at parties. There were no apps, no algorithms, no swiping. You had to work up the nerve to approach someone, and they had to be physically present when you did it.</p><p>Your generation married younger than the ones that followed. The median age at first marriage when you were in your twenties was around 21 for women and 23 for men—numbers that sound impossibly young to your grandchildren. You were expected to have the house, the spouse, and the kids by 30.</p><p>Communication meant phone calls on landlines, handwritten letters, and in-person conversations. Long distance relationships were expensive—literally, by the minute. You couldn't text. You couldn't email until midlife. You had to pick up the phone and actually talk to people, which gave you communication skills that younger generations struggle to replicate.</p><p>Your generation also normalized divorce in ways previous generations hadn't. The divorce rate peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when many of you were starting families. You've watched marriage evolve from economic necessity to personal choice, from 'til death do us part' to 'until we grow apart.'</p><p>You've had to learn entirely new ways of communicating in your later years. Email, texting, video calls, social media—technologies that didn't exist when you were raising kids are now essential for staying connected to grandchildren who communicate primarily through screens.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is the assumption that what worked for you should work for everyone. You bought houses when they cost two years' salary. You paid for college with summer jobs. The economy you entered was designed to create middle-class stability. That economy no longer exists, but the lectures about bootstraps continue.</p><p>You tend to underestimate how much the ground has shifted. When you tell younger people to 'just walk in and ask for a job,' you're giving advice from 1975. When you suggest buying a 'starter home,' you're not accounting for the fact that starter homes in many markets cost $500,000. Your experience, while real, is increasingly irrelevant as a roadmap.</p><p>Your generation accumulated unprecedented wealth, and much of it came from timing. You bought assets before they became unaffordable. You benefited from policies—pensions, Social Security, affordable higher education—that you've been hesitant to extend to following generations. This isn't necessarily malicious, but it is a pattern.</p><p>There's a tendency to dismiss systemic problems as individual failures. If younger people are struggling, it must be their avocado toast, their unwillingness to work hard, their entitlement. The possibility that the system itself has changed—that hard work no longer guarantees stability—is difficult to accept when your own hard work paid off so well.</p><p>Technology is another blind spot. You've adapted remarkably well in many ways, but there's a gap between using technology and understanding how it's reshaping society, politics, and truth itself. The misinformation pipeline that runs through Facebook targets your demographic specifically, and it's working.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people born in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. Baby Boomers as a whole number about 76 million Americans, though that number shrinks each year as your generation ages.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were rebels. They followed rules; you broke them. They saved; you spent. They trusted institutions; you questioned everything—at least in your youth. They were shaped by scarcity; you were shaped by abundance. Your parents couldn't believe how good you had it. Now you can't believe how your grandkids are wasting it.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had it easier economically but harder socially. You faced the draft; they didn't. You built careers at companies that offered pensions and stability; they entered the workforce as those guarantees disappeared. They're the middle children of history—too small to dominate culture, too cynical to expect much.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996) and Gen Z (born 1997-2012), the wealth gap is staggering. Boomers control over 50% of U.S. wealth despite being less than 25% of the adult population. You bought houses that appreciated 400%. You got the last generation of pensions. You'll collect Social Security at levels that may not exist for your grandchildren. This isn't your fault—you didn't design the system—but you did benefit from it in ways younger generations cannot.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was around 68-70 years. Thanks to medical advances, you've beaten that by a decade or more on average. You're the healthiest, longest-lived generation of retirees in human history. You'll spend more years in retirement than your parents spent in adulthood.</p><p>What you've done right: you normalized social change. Civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights—these movements succeeded because your generation forced the conversation. You made the world more tolerant, more inclusive, more open. That's a legacy worth claiming.</p>"
