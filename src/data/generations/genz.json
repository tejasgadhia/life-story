      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Generation Z</h2><p>You're Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012. You're roughly 68 million Americans strong, though counting gets complicated because the youngest of you are still in middle school. You're the first truly digital-native generation—the one that doesn't remember a time before smartphones, social media, or the internet being everywhere.</p><p>Your defining moment was probably the 2020 pandemic, which stole critical years of your adolescence or young adulthood. You did high school over Zoom. You graduated into nothing. You missed proms, graduations, first jobs, first apartments—all the milestones that were supposed to mark your transition to adulthood. The world shut down just when you were supposed to be opening up.</p><p>You've never known economic stability. You were children during the 2008 crisis. You came of age during a pandemic recession. Climate change isn't a future threat to you—it's the weather you grew up with. School shootings aren't abstract tragedies; they're active shooter drills and bulletproof backpacks. Anxiety isn't a diagnosis; it's a baseline.</p><p>Gen Z is defined by pragmatism born of lowered expectations. You don't expect the system to work. You don't trust institutions. You're less idealistic than Millennials were at your age, more focused on what's actually achievable than what should be. You're building alternatives because waiting for the existing structures to fix themselves seems pointless.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You've never known dating without apps. Swiping is natural. The idea of approaching a stranger cold seems terrifying—not because you're anxious (though you are), but because there are apps for this and using them is just more efficient. You've probably never asked someone out without a screen involved.</p><p>Your generation is having less sex than previous generations did at your age. This isn't prudishness; it's pragmatism. Dating apps create paradoxes of choice. Porn is everywhere but connection is harder. You're more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ than any previous generation—not because there are more queer people, but because you're more honest about it.</p><p>You communicate primarily through text, DMs, and video. Phone calls feel invasive—why would someone call without texting first? Email is for teachers and HR departments. Your social lives exist largely online, which means they're always on, always visible, always subject to judgment. The concept of 'logging off' is quaint.</p><p>Friendships form differently for you. You have online friends you've never met who know more about you than people you see every day. You maintain relationships through memes, streaks, and story reactions. The depth is there; the form is different. Older generations don't always understand this, but they don't have to.</p><p>You're delaying traditional relationship milestones—marriage, kids, homeownership—not out of commitment-phobia but out of math. The economics don't work. You're not going to have kids you can't afford, buy houses that don't exist at prices you can pay, or make promises you know you can't keep. That's not cynicism; it's honesty.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is the assumption that everything is content. You've been performing your identity online since childhood. You're so used to curating your lives for an audience that authentic, unwitnessed experience can feel uncomfortable. If it's not documented, did it happen? That's a question you shouldn't have to ask.</p><p>You've internalized social media's metrics as measures of worth. Likes, followers, engagement—these aren't just vanity metrics to you; they're validation. When your content doesn't perform, it feels like you don't matter. This is by design, and you know it, but knowing doesn't always help.</p><p>There's a tendency to mistake information for understanding. You can research anything instantly, which makes you knowledgeable but not always wise. You've read the threads, watched the videos, absorbed the takes—but synthesis takes time you don't always give it. Quick takes reward speed over depth.</p><p>Your generation is politically engaged online but less so at the ballot box. You're great at awareness, less great at showing up. Posting isn't activism, even when it feels like it. Changing your profile picture doesn't change policy. The adults who make decisions are counting on your disengagement.</p><p>You're so accustomed to systemic dysfunction that you sometimes give up before trying. Why vote when the system is rigged? Why apply when you won't get hired? Why try when everything is collapsing? This fatalism is understandable—but it's also a trap. The people who benefit from your despair are counting on you to stay home.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people born in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. Generation Z as a whole numbers about 68 million Americans, slightly larger than Gen X but smaller than Millennials and Boomers.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're more pessimistic but more prepared. They believed the system would eventually work for them; you know it won't. They graduated into recession surprised; you expected nothing else. You're building parallel structures—side hustles, alternative education, mutual aid—because waiting for institutions to serve you is a losing bet.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you share a skepticism of authority but express it differently. They checked out; you're chronically online. They perfected ironic distance; you've mastered performative authenticity. They survived by not caring; you survive by caring very publicly about the right things.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the gap is a canyon. They had it easier than they'll ever admit. They bought houses with one income. They got jobs by showing up. They'll collect Social Security that may not exist when you're 70. The wealth they accumulated—through timing as much as effort—won't flow down to you in time to matter.</p><p>Your life expectancy projections are troubling. For the first time in American history, a generation may live shorter lives than its parents. Climate change, economic precarity, mental health crises, and healthcare costs are all headwinds. You're inheriting a world in worse shape than the one your grandparents were born into.</p><p>What you've done right: you're more honest than any generation before. About identity, about struggle, about mental health, about the systems that don't work. You don't pretend things are fine when they're not. You demand authenticity—from each other, from institutions, from leaders. That demand is powerful, even when it's exhausting. Especially when it's exhausting.</p>"
