      "html": "<h2>The Gen Z Generation</h2><p>Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012. Roughly 68 million Americans strong, though counting gets complicated because the youngest members are still in middle school. This is the first truly digital-native generation—the one that doesn't remember a time before smartphones, social media, or the internet being everywhere.</p><p>The defining moment was likely the 2020 pandemic, which stole critical years of adolescence or young adulthood from the entire cohort. High school happened over Zoom. Graduations were drive-throughs. First jobs, first apartments, all the milestones that were supposed to mark the transition to adulthood—postponed or canceled entirely. The world shut down just when this generation was supposed to be opening up.</p><p>Gen Z has never known economic stability. This cohort was in childhood during the 2008 crisis and came of age during a pandemic recession. Climate change isn't a future threat—it's the weather they grew up with. School shootings aren't abstract tragedies; they're active shooter drills and bulletproof backpacks. Anxiety isn't a diagnosis; it's a baseline.</p><p>Gen Z is defined by pragmatism born of lowered expectations. This generation doesn't expect the system to work and doesn't trust institutions. Less idealistic than Millennials were at the same age, more focused on what's actually achievable than what should be. Building alternatives, because waiting for existing structures to fix themselves seems pointless.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Gen Z has never known dating without apps. Swiping is natural. The idea of approaching a stranger cold seems foreign—not necessarily from anxiety, but because there are apps for this and using them is more efficient. Asking someone out without a screen involved is increasingly rare for this cohort.</p><p>This generation is having less sex than previous generations did at the same age. This isn't prudishness; it's a mix of factors. Dating apps create paradoxes of choice. Pornography is ubiquitous but connection is harder to find. Gen Z is more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ than any previous generation—not because the numbers changed, but because the honesty did.</p><p>Communication happens primarily through text, DMs, and video. Phone calls feel invasive—why would someone call without texting first? Email is for teachers and HR departments. Social lives exist largely online, which means they're always on, always visible, always subject to judgment. The concept of 'logging off' is quaint.</p><p>Friendships form differently for Gen Z. Online friends who've never met in person sometimes know more than people encountered daily in the physical world. Relationships are maintained through memes, streaks, and story reactions. The depth is real; the form is different. Older generations don't always recognize it, but that's their limitation.</p><p>Gen Z is delaying traditional relationship milestones—marriage, kids, homeownership—not from commitment-phobia but from arithmetic. The economics don't work. Having kids that can't be afforded, buying houses that don't exist at attainable prices, making promises that can't be kept—this generation skips all of it. That's not cynicism; it's math.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's biggest blind spot is the assumption that everything is content. Gen Z has been performing identity online since childhood. So accustomed to curating life for an audience that authentic, unwitnessed experience can feel incomplete. If it's not documented, did it happen? That's a question worth examining.</p><p>Social media metrics have become internalized measures of worth. Likes, followers, engagement—these aren't just vanity metrics for Gen Z; they register as validation. When content doesn't perform, it can feel like the person doesn't matter. This is by design, and Gen Z generally knows it, but knowing doesn't always neutralize the effect.</p><p>There's a tendency to mistake information access for understanding. Anything can be researched instantly, which builds knowledge but not always wisdom. The threads have been read, the videos watched, the takes absorbed—but synthesis takes time that the information economy doesn't always reward. Quick takes prize speed over depth.</p><p>Gen Z is politically engaged online but less consistently so at the ballot box. Awareness is strong; turnout is uneven. Posting isn't the same as policy change, even when it feels substantive. Changing a profile picture doesn't change legislation. The people making decisions are generally aware of this pattern.</p><p>There's a familiarity with systemic dysfunction that can tip into resignation. Why vote when the system is broken? Why apply when the odds are long? Why try when the trajectory seems set? This fatalism is understandable given the context—but it's also self-reinforcing. The people who benefit most from disengagement are counting on it continuing.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>A birth cohort of roughly {{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}} people were born in the US in {{BIRTH_YEAR}}. Generation Z as a whole numbers about 68 million Americans, slightly larger than Gen X but smaller than Millennials and Boomers.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), Gen Z is more skeptical but arguably more prepared. Millennials believed the system would eventually work for them; Gen Z assumed it wouldn't. Millennials graduated into recession with surprise; Gen Z expected nothing else. Gen Z builds parallel structures—side hustles, alternative education, mutual aid—because waiting for institutions to deliver feels like a losing strategy.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), Gen Z shares a skepticism of authority but expresses it differently. Gen X checked out; Gen Z is chronically online. Gen X perfected ironic distance; Gen Z has mastered performative authenticity. Gen X survived by disengaging; Gen Z survives by engaging very publicly about the right things.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the gap is enormous. Boomers entered an economy that was structurally favorable in ways that are difficult to replicate. They bought houses with one income, got jobs with a firm handshake, and will collect Social Security at levels that may not exist when Gen Z reaches eligibility. The wealth Boomers accumulated—through timing as much as effort—hasn't transferred down at the pace younger generations need.</p><p>Life expectancy projections for Gen Z carry some concerning signals. Several indicators—climate-related health effects, economic stress, mental health trends, and healthcare costs—represent headwinds that previous generations didn't face at the same scale. The trajectory is worth watching.</p><p>What Gen Z has done right: this generation is more honest than any before it. About identity, about struggle, about mental health, about the systems that aren't working. Gen Z doesn't pretend things are fine when they're not. The demand for authenticity—from each other, from institutions, from leaders—is powerful, even when it's exhausting. Especially when it's exhausting.</p>"
