      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1951-1963</h2><p>Children born in 1951 arrived during the Korean War — the second military conflict in six years, though this one was called a 'police action,' as if the semantics made the dying less real. Their fathers may or may not have served; either way, the war was a reminder that the peace their parents had fought for was fragile. These children grew up in the expanding suburbs of Eisenhower's America, a landscape of new schools, new churches, and new houses so similar they might have been stamped from a mold. The uniformity was the point. After the chaos of depression and war, sameness felt like safety.</p><p>The family structure of their early years was as standardized as the houses. Fathers worked. Mothers managed everything else — the cooking, the cleaning, the emotional labor of keeping a household functional, the volunteer hours at school and church that held communities together. The division was so complete that most children never questioned it. Father was the provider; Mother was the presence. Children were expected to be obedient, self-sufficient during daylight hours, and quiet at dinner. The emotional temperature of the household was set to a steady cool — feelings were managed privately, problems were handled without drama, and the word 'therapy' belonged to other people's families.</p><p>School reinforced the pattern. Desks in rows. The Pledge each morning. Penmanship graded as seriously as arithmetic. At six, duck-and-cover drills entered the routine — crouch beneath the desk, cover the head, wait. The teachers presented these exercises without visible anxiety, treating nuclear preparedness as one more item on the curriculum alongside spelling and long division. Children absorbed both the explicit instruction and the deeper lesson beneath it: that the adult world contained threats too enormous to explain to a child, and that the appropriate response was orderly compliance.</p><p>At six, Sputnik complicated everything. The Soviet satellite's transit across the American sky triggered a curriculum overhaul that these children experienced firsthand — more math, more science, a new national urgency poured into their school days. Teachers who had been teaching reading and geography were suddenly tasked with producing the engineers and scientists who would win the space race. The pressure was abstract but real, filtering down from Washington through state boards to individual classrooms where children were expected to learn faster, think harder, and understand that their multiplication tables were somehow a matter of national defense.</p><p>The civil rights struggle was the other defining current of their childhood, though how visibly it registered depended entirely on geography and family. At four, Rosa Parks refused to move. At six, federal troops escorted nine Black students into Little Rock Central High while mobs raged outside. These images appeared on the television sets that now occupied every living room, and children saw them — the fury, the hatred, the disconnect between the America they were told about in school and the America on the evening news. For some, these moments planted questions that would take years to fully form. For others, the television was switched off, and dinner was served, and the subject was closed.</p><p>Their childhood ended, symbolically and emotionally, on November 22, 1963, when they were twelve. The JFK assassination landed at the exact boundary between childhood and adolescence, ensuring that the transition from one to the other would forever be associated with loss. The world before that Friday was one thing. The world after was something else. These children crossed the threshold carrying that knowledge, and it colored everything that followed.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomers. The name came from demographers who noticed something obvious: soldiers came home from World War II and started families like the survival of the species depended on it. This generation spans 1946 to 1964—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans who would reshape every institution they touched through sheer demographic force.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers born in 1951 were twelve when President Kennedy was assassinated. Seventh grade. November 22, 1963.</span> The principal came on the intercom, or a teacher ran in crying, or someone heard it on a transistor radio. Walter Cronkite took off his glasses on live television and announced the president was dead. Everyone that age remembers where they were. It was the first time this generation understood that the world could break without warning.</p><p>Baby Boomers grew up during the greatest expansion of the American middle class in history. Fathers typically worked one job that paid for a house, a car, a stay-at-home wife, and two weeks at the shore every summer. This wasn't exceptional. This was just how things worked. Nobody called it the American Dream because it was just Tuesday.</p><p>This cohort was eighteen when the draft lottery started, numbers pulled from a glass jar on live television like a deadly game show. Birthdays corresponded to numbers that might send someone to Vietnam or let them stay home. Some friends went. Some didn't come back. Some came back different. The war divided the generation into those who served, those who protested, and those who quietly tried to avoid both.</p><p>Boomers straddled two Americas. They remember the old one—segregated lunch counters, party-line telephones, doctors who made house calls, milk delivered to the door. They built the new one—civil rights marches, counterculture protests, Woodstock, the pill. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This generation questioned everything their parents accepted. Then they grew up, bought houses in the suburbs, and became the establishment they once marched against.</span> <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> The contradictions are theirs to own.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>An American in Paris won Best Picture in 1951, Gene Kelly dancing through soundstages dressed like France. The music was still pre-rock: Nat King Cole crooning 'Too Young,' Tony Bennett breaking through with 'Because of You,' Patti Page asking how much that doggie in the window cost. Bing Crosby and Perry Como dominated the airwaves. This was parents' music. The children's was coming.</p><p>At three, Elvis Presley walked into Sun Studios in Memphis. At five, he appeared on Ed Sullivan, shot from the waist up because his hips were considered too dangerous for American living rooms. At seven, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper died in a plane crash in Iowa—'the day the music died,' Don McLean would call it. Rock and roll was young enough to lose its pioneers while children were still in grade school.</p><p>Television was the revolution. I Love Lucy premiered in 1951, teaching America to laugh at a redhead and her Cuban bandleader husband. Children grew up with Dragnet's 'just the facts, ma'am,' The Lone Ranger's silver bullets, Father Knows Best's suburban certainties. The Army-McCarthy hearings aired when children were three, teaching that adults on television could be cruel. Elvis at five taught they could also be dangerous.</p><p>By high school, everything had changed. The Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan when this cohort was twelve, and 73 million people watched. Teenagers either wanted to be them or date them. Bob Dylan went electric at Newport when they were fourteen, and folk purists booed while the future applauded. The Supremes, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys—AM radio became the soundtrack of adolescence, and everyone knew every word to every song because everyone was listening to the same stations.</p><p>Teenage years collided with counterculture. At sixteen, the Summer of Love. At eighteen, Woodstock—some went, some wish they'd gone, some tell people they went. Hair opened on Broadway. Easy Rider hit theaters. 2001: A Space Odyssey made audiences wonder if they were watching the future or just really high. The culture wasn't just entertainment anymore. It was a declaration of values, a generational divide made visible in hair length and hemlines.</p><p>The pop culture of Boomer youth was communal in ways nothing has been since. Three networks. One radio dial. Everyone saw the same shows, heard the same songs, shared the same references. When Johnny Carson made a joke, the whole country got it. When the Beatles broke up, the whole country mourned. There were no algorithms, no niches, no personalized feeds. Just a shared cultural experience that actually was shared.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>UNIVAC I became the first commercial computer in America in 1951—a machine the size of a room that cost a million dollars and could do less than a calculator that would eventually cost five bucks. Color television was introduced in 1951, though almost nobody had one. Families typically had a black-and-white Philco or RCA, furniture-sized with a screen barely visible from the couch.</p><p>At three, the transistor radio arrived, small enough to fit in a pocket, and suddenly music could go anywhere. At six, the first transatlantic telephone cable was completed—before that, calls across the ocean went by radio and cost a fortune. At seven, Sputnik beeped across the night sky, and America panicked that the Soviets were winning the space race. Math homework suddenly mattered to national security.</p><p>Childhood technology was mechanical, analog, physical. Most families had a party-line telephone—pick up the receiver and sometimes neighbors were already talking. Rotary dials that took forever to spin back. Busy signals that meant try again later. Long-distance calls were expensive enough that families saved them for emergencies and holidays. Three minutes to wish Grandma happy birthday, then hand the phone to a sibling.</p><p>At eighteen, Apollo 11 landed on the moon. July 20, 1969. The world watched it live on television, grainy footage from 238,000 miles away, and Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface while the whole world held its breath. Six hundred million people watched. It felt like anything was possible. The future childhood promised had arrived.</p><p>At twenty, the first ARPANET message was sent—the ancestor of the internet. At twenty-two, the first email. At twenty-six, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold the Apple II. This generation was in their thirties when the IBM PC arrived, their forties when the World Wide Web launched. They learned to type on typewriters, transitioned to word processors, figured out email reluctantly, and watched their grandchildren grow up with phones in their hands.</p><p>Boomers' relationship with technology is earned, not assumed. They remember when there wasn't any. They can write in cursive, read a paper map, do arithmetic without a calculator, remember phone numbers, navigate without GPS. They've watched society become dependent on devices that didn't exist when they were raising children. They're not impressed. They're the last generation that knows, from direct experience, that life worked fine without any of this.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>1951 was the second year of the Korean War, which nobody called a war—they called it a 'police action,' as if that made the dying less real. Fathers might have served. Uncles might have. It ended in 1953, in a stalemate that pleased nobody, and became the 'Forgotten War' because it was sandwiched between World War II's heroism and Vietnam's controversy. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Where were Boomers born in 1951 on November 22, 1963? They were twelve years old.</span></p><p>At three, the Supreme Court ruled on Brown v. Board of Education: separate was not equal, segregation must end. At four, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus. At six, federal troops escorted nine Black students into Little Rock Central High School while mobs screamed outside. The civil rights movement was the moral backdrop of childhood. Where one stood depended on where one lived.</p><p>At twelve, this cohort experienced the moment that would define their generation: President Kennedy's assassination. The generation's detailed memory of that day—the intercom announcement, the teachers crying, the four days of continuous television coverage—is covered in generational identity. What matters historically is simpler: America lost its young president, and the optimism of the early 1960s fractured.</p><p>The sixties unraveled fast after that. At fourteen, Watts burned. At sixteen, Newark and Detroit. At seventeen, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis—April 4, 1968. Two months later, Robert Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles. Tanks in American streets. Cities on fire. The country parents built seemed to be tearing itself apart, and this generation was coming of age in the rubble.</p><p>At eighteen, men walked on the moon. That was July. In December, the draft lottery aired on television—birthdays drawn from a glass jar, numbers assigned to determine who would go to Vietnam. <span class=\"pull-quote\">A date of birth became a ticket in a deadly raffle.</span> If the number was low, someone was going unless they found a way out. College deferments. Medical exemptions. Canada. The war became personal in a way that abstract patriotism couldn't match.</p><p>At twenty-three, this cohort watched Watergate unfold—the hearings, the tapes, Nixon's resignation. At twenty-nine, the Iran hostage crisis. At thirty-eight, the Berlin Wall fell, ending the Cold War that had shaped an entire life. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At fifty-seven, the economy collapsed. At sixty-nine, a pandemic killed more Americans than any war since the Civil War. This generation has lived through so much history that the word 'unprecedented' has lost all meaning.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The class of 1973 entered a labor market during the OPEC oil embargo. Gas prices soared. Nixon resigned. Stagflation made economists question everything they thought they knew. The job market of 1973 offered positions that came with training, benefits, and the expectation of long-term employment. Companies hired expecting to keep workers for decades.</p><p>The career ladder actually existed. Workers could start in the mailroom and end in the corner office. Companies hired expecting to keep employees for decades. They offered training, promotions, pensions. Loyalty was rewarded with security. Job-hopping wasn't necessary—staying meant rising, and rising meant stability for families.</p><p>Boomers normalized the sixty-hour workweek as a badge of honor. They competed by outworking everyone. Long hours weren't exploitation; they were dedication. Workers climbed by showing up first and leaving last, by saying yes to every assignment, by proving they wanted it more than the other person. This worked because the other side of the bargain held: companies that demanded time gave raises, promotions, retirement.</p><p>This generation peaked professionally in their forties and fifties—the decades when Boomers ran everything. CEOs, partners, senators, judges, generals. The generation held the levers of power so long that it started to seem natural. They made the rules. They set the expectations. They decided what success looked like, and it looked a lot like them.</p><p>Manufacturing left during Boomer leadership. The factories that built the middle class moved overseas, chasing cheaper labor. The generation saw it happen and adapted—into services, into management, into industries that required degrees rather than union cards. The workers who couldn't adapt were left behind. That's not entirely their fault, but it's part of their legacy.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> Retirement came with a pension if workers had the right company, Social Security that should last a lifetime, and whatever was saved in IRAs and 401(k)s. Many retired at sixty-five, maybe earlier with a good package. Houses owned outright. Kids grown. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Time for golf, travel, grandchildren. This is the retirement younger generations study like an artifact from a lost civilization.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>The generation that came of age when asking someone out meant walking up to them and using words, out loud, in front of other people. When getting a phone number was a victory even though calling it meant talking to a father first. When a date meant picking someone up at the door, shaking a dad's hand, and having them home by eleven.</p><p>Boomers came of age during the sexual revolution. The pill became legal when this cohort was fourteen. 'Free love' became a slogan when they were sixteen. Everything parents believed about courtship—waiting until marriage, proper introductions, chaperoned dates—was suddenly negotiable. Some embraced the revolution. Some didn't. Most fell somewhere in between, figuring it out as the rules changed beneath their feet.</p><p>Courtship happened at drive-in movies, at diners with jukeboxes, at school dances where chaperones watched for hands in the wrong places. Couples went steady, exchanged class rings, carved initials into trees. Long-distance relationships meant expensive phone calls and letters written by hand on actual paper. There was no texting to say someone was running late. People just showed up late and hoped the other person was still waiting.</p><p>This generation married younger than their children did—mid-twenties was typical, early twenties wasn't unusual. They also divorced at higher rates than any generation before. Whether that's a sign of dysfunction or a sign that people finally had options depends on perspective. The stigma around divorce faded in Boomer lifetimes, making room for second chances that previous generations didn't get.</p><p>Boomers have maintained friendships across decades without social media, without group chats, without any passive way to stay connected. Just phone calls on birthdays, Christmas cards in December, reunions every five or ten years. They remember when friendship required effort—when people had to actually reach out, actually show up, actually maintain the relationship through intention rather than algorithm.</p><p>Relationships in this generation were built on presence. People showed up at weddings, funerals, hospital rooms. They knew neighbors' names, borrowed cups of sugar, watched each other's kids. Community was geography, not hashtags. The relationships that lasted did so because someone put in the work, year after year, without any digital reminders to do so.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Three words shaped Boomer financial psychology before they could spell them: their parents survived the Depression. Parents told them about bread lines, about Hoovervilles, about meals of onions and potatoes because that's all there was. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They taught that security matters more than status, that savings matter more than spending, that the floor can fall out without warning.</span></p><p>At twenty-two, the oil embargo taught that gas prices could double overnight. At twenty-eight, Volcker's Fed raised interest rates to twenty percent to kill inflation—good for savings, brutal for anyone with a mortgage. At thirty-six, Black Monday crashed the stock market twenty-two percent in a single day. This generation has seen volatility. They've also seen recovery. That pattern taught patience: don't panic, stay invested, things come back.</p><p>The financial landscape for those entering adulthood in 1973 unfolded in an era of accessible prosperity. A median house cost roughly three times the median income, not eight or ten times. College tuition at a state school could be covered by a summer job. One income could support a family, buy a house, fund retirement. This wasn't exceptional budgeting. It was just how the math worked.</p><p>The numbers tell the story. Houses bought for <span class=\"stat-box\">$50,000-$60,000</span> are now worth half a million or more. Stocks were invested in that split and split again. Pensions were earned that guaranteed income until death—benefits that companies stopped offering to workers who came after. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Wealth was accumulated the old-fashioned way: buying when things were cheap, holding while they appreciated, retiring before the rules changed.</span></p><p>The numbers told a certain story when Boomers were building wealth. Housing was attainable—three times annual income, not eight or ten. Interest rates fluctuated but down payments were manageable. The financial journey unfolded during an era when the basic arithmetic of middle-class prosperity still added up.</p><p>Now this generation is managing preservation, not accumulation. Healthcare costs that can evaporate savings. Long-term care expenses that dwarf most retirement accounts. The calculation shifts from growing wealth to protecting it—and deciding how much to enjoy versus how much to leave behind.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This cohort's biggest blind spot is the assumption that the conditions they experienced were normal rather than historically specific. The path they walked—affordable education, stable employment, housing within reach—felt like the default state of things. Recognizing that it was a particular moment in economic history, not a universal baseline, requires stepping outside one's own experience. That's difficult for anyone.</p><p>Boomers trust institutions that have spent decades proving themselves untrustworthy. Government, corporations, churches, media—this generation grew up when these institutions mostly worked, mostly told the truth, mostly deserved the benefit of the doubt. They're genuinely baffled when younger people treat them with suspicion. But those younger people watched the Iraq War based on lies, the 2008 collapse based on fraud, the church scandals, the corporate bailouts. Their cynicism isn't attitude. It's evidence-based.</p><p>This generation protested in the sixties, then elected Reagan in the eighties. They marched for civil rights, then moved to suburbs that zoning laws kept segregated. They dropped acid and preached peace, then became the toughest-on-crime voters in American history. The gap between the values they espoused at twenty and the policies they supported at fifty is wider than they'd like to admit. Younger generations notice.</p><p>Technology frustrates Boomers in ways they sometimes can't articulate. It's not that they can't learn—they've learned plenty in seventy-plus years. It's that they don't always see the point. They survived without smartphones, without social media, without constant connectivity. They know, from lived experience, that life worked fine before all this. That knowledge is valuable. But it can also make them dismiss changes that genuinely matter to people who came after.</p><p>Boomers are so used to being in charge that other perspectives can feel like noise. This generation has run things—corporations, governments, institutions—for so long that it seems natural. When younger workers want different things—flexibility, mental health days, work-life balance—Boomers see softness where younger workers see sanity. Both views contain truth. But hearing the other side requires listening, and listening requires stepping back from the center stage Boomers have occupied for sixty years.</p><p>Maybe the hardest blind spot: Boomers see themselves as they were at twenty-five—idealistic, questioning, ready to change the world—rather than as they are now, holding most of the wealth and power in a society where their grandchildren struggle to afford rent. The radical became the establishment. It happens to everyone eventually. Seeing it clearly is the work of wisdom.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>20s (1971-1981):</strong> Vietnam was winding down when this cohort turned twenty—the last combat troops left when they were twenty-two. They entered the workforce during oil crises and stagflation, not the best conditions, but there were jobs to be had and they came with benefits. Marriage typically happened in mid-twenties. Houses were bought for less than a new car costs today. Families started as disco gave way to punk gave way to whatever came next. The Me Decade, they called it, as if self-discovery was something to apologize for.</p><p><strong>30s (1981-1991):</strong> The Reagan years. Morning in America. The economy recovered from the malaise of the seventies, and careers accelerated with it. Kids grew up watching Transformers and G.I. Joe, playing Atari and Nintendo. Workers climbed the corporate ladder that still existed, earned promotions that came with real raises, paid down mortgages on houses that kept appreciating. The Berlin Wall fell when this cohort was thirty-eight—the Cold War they'd grown up with ended not with a bang but with sledgehammers and champagne.</p><p><strong>40s (1991-2001):</strong> Prime earning decade. The Clinton years brought budget surpluses and tech bubbles. The internet arrived and people wondered if it mattered. (It did.) Kids left for college, parents started declining, and this generation became the sandwich generation—managing up and down, responsible for everyone. Career peaks were hit: corner offices, executive titles, seats at tables where decisions were made. Boomers were running things now, and things were going well.</p><p><strong>50s (2001-2011):</strong> September 11 happened when this cohort was fifty. The towers fell, the wars started, the certainties of the nineties evaporated. The housing bubble inflated and then, spectacularly, exploded. 401(k)s lost half their value in 2008. Retirement plans got pushed back. Some lost jobs in mid-fifties, the worst possible timing. The economy that had worked for Boomers suddenly stopped working, though not as badly for them as for those trying to enter it.</p><p><strong>60s (2011-2021):</strong> Recovery, gradual and uneven. The markets came back, investments rebounded, retirement became possible again. Grandchildren arrived. Parents were buried, maybe friends, mortality faced in ways that felt newly urgent. Some retired. Others discovered they couldn't afford to, or didn't want to. This generation stayed in the workforce longer than their parents did, partly by choice, partly by necessity.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2021+):</strong> This generation is here now, navigating a world that changes faster than they'd like. COVID hit Boomers hardest—the death tolls, the isolation, the fear. Healthcare becomes central to daily life. Mobility requires attention. Independence demands maintenance. They've outlived their parents' life expectancy by a decade, thanks to medicine. They'll see great-grandchildren, tell stories about rotary phones and Vietnam, watch the world become unrecognizable. The future belongs to others now. Their job is to share what they learned getting here.</p>"

Boomers expected transformation. Different times produced different responses.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Gen X grew up in Boomer shadow, the forgotten middle child of American generations. Too small to move the demographic needle, too cynical from watching Boomer idealism curdle into Reaganism.

Gen Z has never known a world without internet, without school shooting drills, without climate change as an existential threat.
