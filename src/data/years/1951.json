      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1951-1963</h2><p>You were born the year I Love Lucy premiered and Lucille Ball became America's first television matriarch. Harry Truman was still president, the Korean War was grinding on, and J.D. Salinger published The Catcher in the Rye, giving future generations a template for adolescent alienation you wouldn't appreciate until much later.</p><p>Your childhood was the peak of American postwar prosperity. Eisenhower built highways. Suburbs multiplied like rabbits. Your father probably worked a single job that paid for a house, a car, and a stay-at-home wife. This was considered normal, not exceptional. Nobody called it 'the American Dream' because it was just life.</p><p>You were three when Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation unconstitutional. Seven when Sputnik launched and suddenly every kid needed to learn math or the Soviets would win. Eight when Alaska and Hawaii became states. You grew up ducking under desks during nuclear drills, convinced the Soviets might drop bombs any minute. The Cold War wasn't abstract—it was the air you breathed.</p><p>Television defined your childhood in ways previous generations couldn't imagine. You watched the Mickey Mouse Club, Howdy Doody, and Leave It to Beaver. You saw history happen in real-time: Eisenhower on the golf course, Elvis on Ed Sullivan from the waist up, quiz show scandals that taught you adults sometimes lied. The television was a furniture piece in the living room, and the whole family gathered around it like a hearth.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That's the demographic bulge created when soldiers came home from World War II and started making up for lost time. Your generation is roughly 76 million people in the US, which made you the largest cohort in American history until Millennials eventually surpassed you by a nose.</p><p>The defining moments for early Boomers were the Kennedy assassination and Vietnam. You were twelve when JFK was shot in Dallas. Old enough to understand, young enough for it to shatter your assumptions about American safety. You probably remember exactly where you were when you heard. Everyone does.</p><p>Your generation was the first to grow up with television, the first to experience mass youth culture, the first to make 'teenager' a marketing demographic. You invented rock and roll fandom, protested Vietnam, experimented with drugs, and demanded civil rights. Then you grew up, bought houses, and became the establishment you once protested.</p><p>Boomers are wedged between the Silent Generation (who fought the wars and kept their heads down) and Gen X (who inherited your cynicism without your numbers). You're large enough to dominate every election, every market, every cultural conversation. You've been the main character of American life for sixty years, and you're not ready to give that up.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year An American in Paris won Best Picture and Gene Kelly danced through the streets of Hollywood's version of France. The music scene was still crooning—Tony Bennett released 'Because of You,' and Mario Lanza made opera semi-accessible to the masses. Rock and roll hadn't been invented yet. Neither had teenagers, really.</p><p>But things moved fast. You were three when Elvis recorded at Sun Studios. Five when he appeared on Ed Sullivan, shot from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous for America. Seven when Buddy Holly died in a plane crash, the day the music died. By the time you hit high school, the British Invasion had landed, and every kid wanted to be a Beatle.</p><p>Television in 1951 was brand new and revolutionary. I Love Lucy taught America to laugh at a redhead and a Cuban bandleader. Edward R. Murrow showed that TV could be serious. By the time you were a teenager, you'd watched the Kennedy-Nixon debates, the first televised presidential showdown, and understood that looking good on camera now mattered as much as policy.</p><p>Your teenage years were peak counterculture. Bob Dylan went electric. The Beatles went psychedelic. Woodstock happened when you were eighteen—you either went or you wish you had. The Summer of Love, the Chicago Seven, Kent State. Your generation's pop culture wasn't just entertainment. It was revolution, or at least it felt like it.</p><p>The pop culture of your youth was communal in ways nothing has been since. Three networks, everyone watching the same shows, everyone hearing the same songs on AM radio. No algorithms, no niches, no infinite scroll. Just shared cultural experiences that actually were shared.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year UNIVAC I became the first commercial computer in America, a machine the size of a room that could do less than your phone does now. Color TV was introduced in 1951, though almost nobody had one. Most families were still excited about black-and-white.</p><p>Your childhood was the last gasp of the pre-electronic age. You probably had a party line telephone, where neighbors could listen to your calls. Rotary dials. Busy signals. Operators who connected you manually. Long-distance calls were expensive and reserved for emergencies or holidays.</p><p>You were eleven when the first communications satellite launched. Fifteen when the first computer mouse was invented. Eighteen when Apollo 11 landed on the moon—you watched it live, grainy footage on a television set, and it felt like anything was possible. Twenty-two when the first email was sent. Twenty-six when Apple released the Apple II.</p><p>You're the generation that bridged typewriters and computers. You learned to work on paper, transitioned to word processors in your thirties, and figured out email in your forties. Some of you embraced technology. Others peaked at the VCR and called it a day.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is pragmatic. You didn't grow up with screens, so you know what life looks like without them. You can write a letter, read a map, do math without a calculator. You've watched society become dependent on devices you survived perfectly well without. You're not impressed by technology—you're the last generation that remembers when there was an alternative.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the Korean War, which your parents probably didn't talk about much. The 'Forgotten War' they called it, sandwiched between World War II's heroism and Vietnam's controversy. It ended when you were two, a stalemate nobody wanted to celebrate.</p><p>You were three when the Supreme Court ruled on Brown v. Board of Education. Five when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. Seven when troops escorted the Little Rock Nine into school. The civil rights movement was the moral backdrop of your childhood, though depending on where you lived, you might have been on either side of it.</p><p>You were twelve when President Kennedy was assassinated. Everyone remembers that day. The principal's announcement, the teachers crying, Walter Cronkite taking off his glasses. Something broke in America that afternoon in Dallas, some assumption about safety and progress. Nothing felt quite the same after.</p><p>You were seventeen during the Summer of Love and eighteen when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated within two months. Riots in the cities. Tanks in the streets. The country felt like it was tearing itself apart, and you were coming of age in the rubble.</p><p>You were eighteen when men walked on the moon. That was the upside—the proof that America could still do impossible things when it tried. But you were also eighteen when the draft lottery started, and suddenly Vietnam wasn't just news. It was personal. Your number, your friends' numbers, the random chance that determined who went to war.</p><p>You were twenty-three during Watergate. Twenty-nine during the Iranian hostage crisis. Thirty-nine when the Berlin Wall fell. Fifty during 9/11. Fifty-seven during the 2008 financial crisis. Sixty-nine when COVID hit. You've lived through more history than most generations, and you've watched the country you grew up in transform into something barely recognizable.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1973, right into the oil crisis and stagflation. Not the best timing, but it got better. Your generation benefited from an expanding economy that actually rewarded loyalty. You stayed at companies for decades. They gave you pensions. This was considered normal.</p><p>Your career unfolded during the great American corporate expansion. You watched companies grow into conglomerates. You saw manufacturing leave for cheaper shores. You witnessed the rise of the service economy, the information economy, and whatever economy we're in now.</p><p>You're the generation that invented the sixty-hour workweek as a badge of honor. You competed by outworking everyone. You climbed ladders that actually existed. Promotions came with raises. Loyalty was rewarded with security. You didn't have to explain 'quiet quitting' because quitting quietly would have been shameful.</p><p>You probably peaked professionally in your forties and fifties, the decades when Boomers ran everything. CEOs, senators, partners, directors—your generation dominated every institution. You made the rules. You set the norms. You decided how things worked, and things worked pretty well for you.</p><p>Retirement, if you've done it, came with a pension, Social Security, and whatever you saved in your 401(k). You might have retired at 65, maybe earlier with a good package. You own your house. Your kids are grown. You can golf, travel, pursue hobbies. This is the retirement your children can't imagine because it won't be available to them at any price.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which meant everything your parents believed about courtship was suddenly negotiable. Free love, birth control pills, women's liberation—the rules changed faster than anyone could keep up. You dated in cars, at drive-ins, at diners. Nobody swiped right. You actually had to talk to people.</p><p>You probably married younger than your children did—mid-twenties was typical, early twenties wasn't unusual. Your generation had the highest divorce rate in history, which was either a sign of dysfunction or a sign that people finally had options. Probably both.</p><p>You communicated by phone, by letter, by showing up at people's houses. Long-distance relationships meant expensive phone bills and handwritten correspondence. You couldn't text someone you were running late. You just showed up late and apologized. There was no read receipt anxiety because there were no read receipts.</p><p>Your generation reinvented marriage several times. First marriages in your twenties, sometimes divorces in your thirties, remarriages in your forties. Blended families, step-parents, half-siblings—you normalized configurations that previous generations considered scandalous. Your grandparents stayed married out of obligation. You stayed married only if it worked.</p><p>You've maintained friendships across decades in ways younger generations struggle to imagine. No social media reminders, no group chats. Just phone calls on birthdays, holiday cards in December, reunions every few years. Relationships required effort because there was no passive way to stay connected.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were twenty-two during the first oil crisis, which taught you that gas prices could double overnight. Twenty-eight when Volcker's Federal Reserve jacked interest rates to 20% to kill inflation. Thirty-six during Black Monday, when the stock market crashed 22% in a single day. You've seen volatility, but you've also seen recovery.</p><p>Your financial life was defined by accessible prosperity. Houses cost three times your annual salary, not ten times. College was affordable enough that working summers could cover tuition. You could support a family on one income, buy a car with cash, and still save for retirement. This wasn't exceptional planning—it was just math that worked.</p><p>You save because your parents lived through the Depression and taught you that security matters more than status. You probably have pensions, Social Security, savings accounts that actually earn interest. You've accumulated wealth the old-fashioned way: buying assets when they were cheap and watching them appreciate for forty years.</p><p>Your generation controls most of the wealth in America. Not because you're smarter or harder working, but because you entered the economy when the math still worked. You bought houses for $50,000 that are now worth $500,000. You invested when the market only went up. You retired with pensions that don't exist anymore.</p><p>You've been told you're selfish, that you pulled the ladder up behind you, that your wealth came at younger generations' expense. Maybe. Or maybe you just played by the rules that existed and won. The rules changed after. That's not your fault, but it is your legacy.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest weakness is difficulty recognizing how much the rules have changed. You worked hard and succeeded, so you assume anyone who works hard can succeed. But the economy that rewarded your effort doesn't exist anymore. The math doesn't math the same way. Houses cost more, wages buy less, and bootstraps don't stretch as far.</p><p>You're so used to being in charge that you sometimes forget to listen. Your generation has run things for so long that other perspectives can feel like noise. Younger workers have different values—they want work-life balance, mental health days, remote flexibility. You see laziness. They see sanity. Both views contain truth.</p><p>You trust institutions that have proven untrustworthy. Government, corporations, media, churches—you grew up when these institutions mostly worked, mostly told the truth, mostly deserved respect. You're baffled by younger generations' cynicism, but they've watched these institutions fail in real-time. Their distrust is earned.</p><p>Your generation is sometimes better at talking about change than making it. You protested in the sixties, then elected Reagan in the eighties. You championed civil rights while benefiting from systems that perpetuated inequality. You wanted revolution but settled for retirement accounts. The gap between your ideals and your outcomes is wider than you like to admit.</p><p>You struggle with technology in ways that frustrate younger people. Not because you can't learn, but because you don't always want to. You survived without smartphones, so you don't see why everyone needs one. This makes you seem out of touch in a world that's moved on, but it also means you know something valuable: life worked before all this, and it could work again.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1971-1981):</strong> You came of age in the aftermath of the sixties. Vietnam was ending, Nixon resigned, the economy was a mess. But you were young, and young people adapt. You got jobs, got married, bought houses that cost less than cars cost now. You started families, established careers, laid foundations. The disco era, punk rock, the Me Decade—you lived all of it.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1981-1991):</strong> The Reagan years. Morning in America. The economy recovered, your career accelerated, your kids grew up in relative prosperity. You watched the Berlin Wall fall on television. The Cold War that defined your childhood ended with a whimper. You were established now—mortgages paid down, promotions earned, responsibilities multiplied. This was peak accumulation.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1991-2001):</strong> Your prime earning decade. Clinton-era prosperity, tech boom, stock market euphoria. Your kids left for college, your parents started aging, and you found yourself sandwiched between generations. You hit career peaks—corner offices, executive titles, seats at tables that mattered. You watched the internet arrive and wondered if it would change everything. (It would.)</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2001-2011):</strong> 9/11 happened when you were fifty. The wars started. The housing bubble inflated then exploded. You watched your 401(k) lose half its value in 2008, maybe more. Retirement plans got pushed back. Some of you lost jobs, lost houses, lost certainty. The economy that worked for you suddenly stopped working, though not as badly for you as for those who came after.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2011-2021):</strong> Recovery, of a sort. The economy came back, your investments rebounded, retirement became possible again. You watched grandchildren arrive. You buried parents. You faced your own mortality in ways that felt newly urgent. Some of you retired. Others couldn't afford to. All of you realized the finish line was closer than the starting line.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2021+):</strong> You're here now. COVID was a dark cloud, especially for your generation. Healthcare becomes central. Mobility changes. Independence requires maintenance. You've outlived your parents' generation by a decade, thanks to medicine. You'll see grandchildren grow up, great-grandchildren arrive. You'll tell stories about a world without computers, without civil rights, without any of the things younger people take for granted. They won't quite believe you.</p>"

The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US, which made you the demographic giant that reshaped every institution you touched.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you're louder, more numerous, and more willing to challenge authority. They survived Depression and war, kept their heads down, followed rules. You questioned everything, protested everything, demanded explanations. They were grateful for stability. You expected transformation.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more optimistic and more dominant. Gen X grew up in your shadow, too small to move the needle, too cynical to try. They got your scraps—the jobs you didn't want, the houses you didn't buy, the economy after you'd extracted the easy profits. They've spent their lives waiting for you to retire so they could finally run something.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're wealthier, more established, and more puzzled by their complaints. Millennials entered the workforce during the Great Recession, graduated with crushing debt, and watched housing become impossible. They blame you for pulling up the ladder. You think they just need to work harder. Neither view captures the full picture.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you might as well be from different planets. They've never known a world without internet, without school shootings, without climate change as an existential threat. They see the future you're leaving them and they're not grateful. They're terrified.</p><p>Your life expectancy was around 68 years when you were born. Now it's closer to 79. You've gained a decade of life that previous generations didn't get. You've used it—traveling, working, consuming, influencing. Your generation refuses to fade quietly. You've always been the main character, and you're not interested in becoming a supporting role.</p>"
