      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1953-1965</h2><p>The smell of Brylcreem and fathers' Lucky Strikes. The crinkle of wax paper around a bologna sandwich. The satisfying click of Tinkertoys snapping together on the living room floor. Childhood in the early 1950s had a texture that nobody born after 1970 will ever understand—everything was slower, smaller, safer. Or at least it felt that way.</p><p>The year this cohort was born, Swanson invented the TV dinner. By the time they were three, families probably had aluminum trays of turkey and mashed potatoes in front of the Dumont, watching Howdy Doody or The Lone Ranger. Mothers served Jell-O salads with things suspended in them that had no business being in Jell-O. Cream cheese and pineapple. Shredded carrots. This was considered elegant.</p><p>At four, children got their first taste of the new world: Disneyland opened in 1957. At five, Sputnik beeped across the night sky, and suddenly teachers cared very much about science and math. Children did duck-and-cover drills, crouching under wooden desks as if plywood could stop an atom bomb. They practiced for the apocalypse between spelling tests.</p><p>Toys were built to last—and occasionally to injure. Erector Sets with actual sharp metal edges. Cap guns with roll caps that smelled like sulfur and summer. Lincoln Logs for building, Silly Putty for pressing against newspaper comics and watching the ink transfer. Slinky before they made it plastic, when it was heavy enough to actually hurt someone.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant walking to the Woolworth's lunch counter with a dime for a cherry Coke, then catching a double feature at the movie palace downtown—the kind with velvet seats and a balcony. At seven, children watched the Greensboro sit-ins on television and didn't fully understand what they were seeing. At nine, they watched a man orbit the Earth. At ten, a president was shot in Dallas, and nothing ever felt quite as simple again.</p><p>Parents remembered the Depression. They remembered rationing, Victory Gardens, gold-star mothers. They raised children in abundance specifically because they'd known scarcity. Children got Schwinn bicycles and Roy Rogers lunch boxes and a childhood that assumed the future would be even better. Parents couldn't have known what was coming.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The word sounds quaint now, like something from a sociology textbook. But this was the first generation named as a demographic phenomenon, the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans born between 1946 and 1964 who became a tidal wave reshaping everything they touched—schools, then colleges, then the job market, then the housing market, then Medicare.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers born in 1953 were ten when Kennedy was assassinated. Sitting in a fifth-grade classroom, probably, when the principal's voice came over the intercom.</span> They watched Walter Cronkite take off his glasses and announce the president was dead. They watched their parents cry—maybe the first time they'd seen that. They learned, in a single November afternoon, that the adults weren't actually in charge of anything.</p><p>This generation spans 1946 to 1964, which means they share a label with people born when they were already in sixth grade. The early Boomers—this cohort—are different from the late ones. They remember the before times: the optimism of Eisenhower's America, the belief that problems had solutions, the confidence that the future would be better. Late Boomers were born into Vietnam and Watergate. This cohort remembers what was lost.</p><p>At eleven, this cohort watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan with 73 million other Americans. At fifteen, they were old enough to understand what Vietnam meant but too young to go. At eighteen, in 1971, the draft was still active, and every birthday was a lottery they hoped to lose. Some friends went. Some didn't come back. Some came back different. This was their war, whether they fought in it or not.</p><p>This generation invented the teenager as a market category. Before Boomers, adolescence was just a waiting room for adulthood. They turned it into a culture—blue jeans, rock records, muscle cars, rebellion as a brand. Madison Avenue noticed. They've been selling youth back to young people ever since, but Boomers were the original target demographic.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">Now Boomers are blamed for everything from the housing crisis to climate change to the general state of things. Some of it's fair. They did vote for the policies that got us here.</span> But every generation breaks what it touches. Boomers were just large enough that the breakage shows. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year this cohort was born, I Love Lucy was the number-one show in America. Lucille Ball was pregnant on television, which was considered scandalous—they couldn't say the word 'pregnant,' so they said 'expecting.' That same year, Ian Fleming published Casino Royale, inventing James Bond. Playboy launched with Marilyn Monroe on the cover. The culture they'd inherit was already being assembled.</p><p>Early TV diet was The Mickey Mouse Club, Howdy Doody, and Captain Kangaroo. Children knew every word of 'M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E' before they could spell their own name. The Lone Ranger taught that good guys wore white. Dragnet taught that crime didn't pay. Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang about happy trails while children ate Cheerios from a Roy Rogers cereal bowl.</p><p>At three, Davy Crockett hit the airwaves, and suddenly every kid in America needed a coonskin cap. Parents probably stood in line at Sears to buy one. At four, Elvis Presley appeared on Ed Sullivan, shot from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous for America. Parents thought rock and roll was noise. Children thought it was the future.</p><p>At eleven, the Beatles landed at JFK, and children watched teenage girls scream so hard they fainted. They were thirteen when the British Invasion hit full force—Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks. Arguments with friends about whether the Beatles or the Stones were better. (This argument is still unresolved.) At fourteen, Bob Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at Newport and folk purists booed like he'd betrayed them personally.</p><p>Adolescence was Motown and psychedelia. Martha and the Vandellas. The Supremes in matching sequined dresses. Then Sgt. Pepper's dropped when this cohort was fourteen, and music became something to study, not just hear. At sixteen, they were watching 2001: A Space Odyssey in theaters, trying to figure out what the monolith meant. At seventeen, Woodstock happened. Maybe they were there; maybe they wished they were; maybe they're tired of being asked.</p><p>At nineteen, The Godfather changed American cinema—suddenly movies could be art and entertainment simultaneously. At twenty, American Graffiti made them nostalgic for a childhood they'd only just left. The culture they grew up with was shared. Three networks. Top 40 radio. Everyone watched the same thing, argued about the same thing, sang the same songs at the same parties. They had a common language that doesn't exist anymore.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year this cohort was born, UNIVAC predicted Eisenhower's election victory on live television—a computer the size of a room, doing calculations that a phone could now handle in a microsecond. Computers were science fiction. Technology was something that happened at Bell Labs and IBM, not in houses. Houses had a rotary phone on the wall and maybe a Philco radio in the living room. That was high tech.</p><p>At one, families probably got their first television—a hulking wooden cabinet with a screen the size of a porthole, picking up three channels if the antenna was pointed right. Children grew up adjusting rabbit ears and thumping the side of the set when the picture rolled. At five, they watched the first color broadcast, though they probably didn't see it in color—that came later. At seven, the transistor radio arrived, and suddenly music was portable. Children could listen to Elvis in their bedroom without parents knowing.</p><p>At four, Sputnik beeped across the night sky, and America panicked. The Soviets were ahead. This cohort was part of the generation that would have to catch up. At sixteen, they watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon—grainy footage on a television that still needed a moment to warm up. Humans on the moon. It felt like the beginning of something infinite.</p><p>Boomers learned to type on manual typewriters, the kind where they could feel the resistance of each key, where mistakes meant correction ribbon or starting over. They used carbon paper to make copies. They looked things up in encyclopedias, which were obsolete before they finished paying for them. They calculated with slide rules before calculators made them antiques.</p><p>At thirty-two, the personal computer arrived—the Apple II, then the IBM PC. At forty-two, the World Wide Web launched, though it took another few years before people understood what it was. At forty-eight, Google appeared. At fifty-one, the iPod. At fifty-four, the iPhone changed everything, putting a computer in a pocket that would have seemed like magic in 1953.</p><p>Boomers have survived more technological disruptions than any generation in history. Vinyl to cassette to CD to streaming. Film to digital. Letters to email to texts to whatever the kids are using now. They're not slow with technology—they're exhausted by it. They've had to relearn how the world works every decade. The young people who mock their texting speed have no idea how many times they've started over from scratch.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At ten, Kennedy was assassinated—November 22, 1963. Where were Boomers born in 1953 when they heard?</span> The historical cascade that followed: the escalation in Vietnam, the Civil Rights Act passage, the long decade of marches, riots, and assassinations that transformed America.</p><p>At eleven, this cohort watched the Civil Rights Act pass. At twelve, they saw the marchers in Selma beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge—the footage played on the evening news, and even in living rooms far from Alabama, people had to reckon with what they were seeing. At fifteen, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy. Cities burned. It felt like the country was tearing itself apart. Maybe it was.</p><p>Vietnam was this cohort's war. They were eighteen in 1971, draft-eligible, watching the lottery balls spin on television. Their number could have sent them to a jungle on the other side of the world, or not. Some friends went. Some protested. Some did both. At twenty-two, they watched the helicopters lift off from the Saigon embassy roof—the end of a war that had defined their adolescence, though the men who fought it are still fighting something.</p><p>At twenty-one, this cohort watched Nixon resign. Watergate taught this generation what the younger ones already suspected: that authority lies, that power corrupts, that the system is not worthy of blind faith. 'I am not a crook' became a punchline. They learned not to trust anyone over thirty, then turned thirty and wondered why no one trusted them.</p><p>At thirty-six, this cohort watched the Berlin Wall come down. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The Cold War that had shadowed their entire life—the duck-and-cover drills, the Cuban Missile Crisis when they were nine and thought the world might actually end—was suddenly over.</span> They watched crowds dancing on the rubble and wondered what came next.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> The Pentagon in flames. A field in Pennsylvania. They were old enough to contextualize it, to know that this was a pivot point, but also old enough to have seen pivot points before. At fifty-five, the financial system collapsed. At sixty-seven, a pandemic shut down the world, and their age group was the most vulnerable. This generation has lived through more 'unprecedented' events than most generations see in multiple lifetimes. The word has lost its meaning.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about timing. This cohort graduated into the 1970s economy—stagflation, oil embargoes, gas lines snaking around blocks. The post-war miracle that had employed their fathers was sputtering. But here's the thing: the fundamentals still worked. A company would hire. Train. Keep. Give a pension at the end. The deal was brutal by today's standards—forty years for a gold watch—but it was a deal. That deal doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>Workers probably started at one company and stayed, or maybe two. Job-hopping was for losers. Loyalty was a value, not a liability. Business cards meant something—not just a title, but membership in an institution. Workers climbed the ladder rung by rung because that was the only direction the ladder went. Meritocracy was flawed, but it existed as a concept people believed in.</p><p>Women of this generation entered the workforce in numbers that terrified and confused the men already there. If Boomer women worked in the 1970s and 80s, they know what it cost: the comments, the assumptions, the glass ceiling nobody admitted existed. They wore power suits with shoulder pads like armor. They were twice as good to be considered half as qualified. Some broke through. Many were broken by the effort.</p><p>Peak earning years coincided with the longest economic expansion in American history—the Clinton-era boom when the stock market seemed incapable of going down. Workers had a corner office, or at least an office with a door. They had a secretary, then an assistant, then a shared admin pool, then Microsoft Outlook and the expectation that they'd handle their own calendar. The technology kept changing job descriptions.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and Boomers had to deliver the bad news.</span> Layoffs. Pension freezes. The 'new normal' speeches that nobody believed. They managed kids who'd been promised everything and received rubble. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The irony—that the system had rewarded Boomer loyalty and was now punishing younger ambition—wasn't lost on anyone.</span></p><p>Retirement, if reached, looks nothing like the brochure. Social Security exists but doesn't cover what it should. 401(k)s took hits in 2000, 2008, and 2020. Boomers are either still working by choice, still working by necessity, or doing careful math about how long savings have to last. The finish line keeps moving.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>The generation that came of age when getting someone's phone number meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer. When a date meant being picked up at the door, meeting the parents, being home by midnight. When 'going steady' was declared with a class ring on a chain around the neck. The rules were rigid, but at least they were clear.</p><p>The Pill was approved when this cohort was seven. By the time they were dating, it had changed everything—or at least the possibility of everything. The sexual revolution sounds more liberated than it felt for most people. New freedoms came with new confusions. Parents' scripts no longer applied, but nobody had written replacements. They figured it out as they went, often badly.</p><p>This generation probably married younger than their children will—mid-twenties was typical, early twenties not unusual. The wedding was at the church the family attended. The reception was in the fellowship hall, not a destination venue. They got a toaster, a blender, a set of dishes. They set up house on furniture parents gave them or they bought at Sears on layaway.</p><p>This generation normalized divorce. Before Boomers, marriage was essentially permanent—stigma kept people trapped in misery. They gave themselves permission to leave. California's no-fault divorce law passed when this cohort was sixteen. By the time they were thirty, half the marriages around them were ending. Sometimes staying was brave. Sometimes leaving was braver. The judgment eased, slowly.</p><p>If Boomer women negotiated the impossible math of their generation: career expectations rising just as they started a family, domestic labor still falling disproportionately on them. The 'second shift' wasn't a phrase yet, but they lived it. Working all day, then working all evening. Husbands 'helped out' in language that told them everything.</p><p>Boomers have maintained relationships across every communication technology humans have invented. Love letters in cursive. Long-distance calls that cost a dollar a minute, so people watched the clock while their heart raced. Email, then texts, then video calls with grandchildren across the country. They know how to write a proper note of thanks. They also know how to use FaceTime, even if the angle isn't flattering.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Here are the numbers, because the numbers tell the story. When this cohort was thirty, in 1983, the median home price was <span class=\"stat-box\">$70,000</span>—about 2.8 times the median household income. Today it's over six times. When they graduated college—if they went—tuition at a state university was about <span class=\"stat-box\">$500 a year</span>. Adjusted for inflation, that's roughly $3,500. Current average: <span class=\"stat-box\">$11,000</span>. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Children's children will need six-figure debt for what cost Boomers a summer job.</span></p><p>Parents survived the Depression. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They saved obsessively, distrusted banks, kept cash in coffee cans. They bought one house and stayed in it forever. They wore clothes until they wore out.</span> This caution was passed to Boomers—but they inherited it alongside an economy that rewarded spending. Easy credit. Rising home values. A pension at the end of the rainbow. They were taught to save and lived in a world that paid them to borrow.</p><p>Boomers bought their first house for what now sounds like a typo. Maybe $40,000 in the mid-1970s. That house appreciated while they slept. They didn't do anything—they just showed up and waited. The system was designed to reward patience, and they were patient. The system then changed, but they'd already gotten theirs.</p><p>Boomer financial timeline benefited from being in the right place at the right time. Houses appreciated while mortgages were held. Markets rose over the decades they invested. The basic math of compound interest, applied over forty years, created wealth without requiring genius—just patience and presence. Time in the market matters, and Boomers had the time.</p><p>Current financial concerns have shifted from building to preserving. Healthcare costs that can consume savings rapidly. The uncertainty of how long retirement needs to last when life expectancy keeps extending. The calculations change when protecting accumulated wealth rather than creating it.</p><p>Financial anxiety now is about preservation, not acquisition. Healthcare costs that can bankrupt a family. Long-term care that costs more than most people earn. The calculation of how much to leave the kids versus how much to spend while they can still enjoy it. The math is different when protecting a pile instead of building one.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This cohort's biggest blind spot is survivorship bias—the natural human tendency to assume that what worked for them represents a universal truth rather than a historical moment. Their experience was real. The conditions that made it possible were specific to their era. Separating the two requires conscious effort.</p><p>Boomers were taught that hard work correlates with success. For this generation, the correlation was strong enough to feel like causation. The relationship between effort and outcome varies by era, by circumstance, by factors beyond individual control. Recognizing that doesn't diminish their achievements—it contextualizes them. Context is what wisdom looks like.</p><p>This generation normalized dysfunction that younger generations are now trying to name. Workaholism wasn't a disorder—it was a virtue. Burning out meant they were committed. Staying late was dedication. Mental health was weakness; therapy was self-indulgent; needing help was failure. They wore these beliefs like badges and passed them to their children, who are now paying therapists to undo the damage.</p><p>This generation is sometimes blind to its collective power precisely because they experienced it as individual effort. They worked hard; they succeeded; therefore work causes success. But individual effort occurred within collective systems—tax policies, regulations, environmental decisions. The choices this generation made, voting booth by voting booth, shaped the landscape everyone navigates. That's not accusation; it's just how democracy works. Every generation inherits the previous one's decisions and makes its own.</p><p>Boomers vote in larger numbers than any other generation. They control boardrooms, courtrooms, legislatures, and homeowner associations. The policies younger generations find frustrating were written by people who look like Boomers. The system isn't just broken—it was designed to work for the people who designed it. That's not conspiracy; it's how power works.</p><p>Boomers have been called selfish so often that they've stopped hearing it, which is understandable. Every generation is selfish. This one just happened to be large enough, wealthy enough, and long-lived enough that the selfishness shows. The defensiveness is natural. The inability to receive feedback is expensive—not for Boomers, but for everyone who comes after.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>20s (1973-1983):</strong> This cohort entered adulthood during the hangover from the sixties. Vietnam ended when they were twenty-two. Nixon resigned when they were twenty-one. Stagflation made economists question everything. Gas lines stretched around blocks; they waited with an empty tank and thought about rationing stories parents told. But they were young, and the fundamentals still worked. They got hired. They got married—mid-twenties, probably. They bought a house for what now sounds fictional. The economy stumbled, but they kept their footing.</p><p><strong>30s (1983-1993):</strong> Morning in America, if they believed the slogans. Reagan, then Bush. The Cold War ending in slow motion—Gorbachev, glasnost, words that had to be explained. Kids were born in this decade. The minivan replaced the muscle car. They coached Little League, helped with homework, wondered where their twenties went. Careers climbed steadily. Pensions vested. Houses appreciated. They were doing what the script demanded, and the script was working.</p><p><strong>40s (1993-2003):</strong> The Clinton boom years. The internet arrived, first as curiosity, then as revolution. They got their first email address at work. Companies reorganized themselves every eighteen months to capture 'synergy.' They survived layoffs, mergers, acquisitions. Kids became teenagers, which was its own kind of crisis. The stock market doubled, then doubled again. 401(k)s looked like magic. Then planes hit buildings, and they watched their second impossible thing on television, nearly forty years after the first.</p><p><strong>50s (2003-2013):</strong> Iraq. Afghanistan. The forever wars this generation's children fought. At fifty-five, the financial system collapsed, and retirement timelines shattered. The portfolio that looked like enough wasn't enough. Kids graduated into rubble—the worst job market since the Depression. They moved back home, or needed help with rent, or couldn't buy houses the way Boomers had. Boomers wondered if they'd failed them somehow. The math said otherwise, but guilt doesn't do math.</p><p><strong>60s (2013-2023):</strong> The long goodbye to work, whether they wanted it or not. Some retired on schedule. Some were pushed out early. Some keep working because the alternative doesn't cover healthcare. Grandchildren arrived, giving everything new meaning. Then COVID hit when they were sixty-seven—their age group most vulnerable, locked down longest, losing friends to a virus that picked its targets with cruel precision. They survived. Many did. Not everyone.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2023+):</strong> This is now. They're managing health with more attention than ever—doctors' appointments, prescriptions, the awareness that the body is finite. This generation is living longer than any before, which is miracle and burden simultaneously. The world their grandchildren will inherit looks nothing like the one they entered. They have wisdom to offer, though nobody seems interested in hearing it. They have regrets, of course. But also: a life that mattered, work that meant something, people who love them. The story ends when it ends. Not yet.</p>"

They're part of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans classified as Baby Boomers—a demographic tidal wave that reshaped schools, then colleges, then the workforce, then the housing market, then Medicare. Every institution they touched had to expand to accommodate them, then figure out what to do when they moved on.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They survived the Depression and won World War II. They followed rules because rules had kept them alive. Boomers inherited their prosperity and questioned their obedience. They worked quietly; Boomers demanded to be heard. They saved for rainy days; Boomers assumed the weather would hold. They called Boomers conformist. Boomers called them ungrateful. Both had points.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The forgotten middle child of generations. Gen X entered the workforce during recessions Boomers had helped create. They watched pensions disappear before they could vest. They were too young for Woodstock, too old for the internet boom. They're cynical because cynicism was survival. Boomers are optimistic because optimism paid off. The gap between those attitudes maps almost perfectly onto the gap in net worth.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap is the headline.</span> When Boomers were in their forties, this generation controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age control 7%. Boomers bought houses for three times their salary. Millennials are looking at six to eight times theirs—if they can look at all. Millennials are the most educated generation in American history, and they're operating in an economy that doesn't reward education the way Boomers' did. Different circumstances, different outcomes.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They might as well be from different planets. Gen Z has never known a world without internet, without school shooting drills, without climate anxiety as background noise. They don't expect the system to work because they've never seen it work. Boomer optimism looks like denial to them. Gen Z pragmatism looks like giving up to Boomers. Neither is entirely wrong.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers control <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Life expectancy at birth was sixty-nine years. Boomers have beaten that already, most likely. Modern medicine and better nutrition have extended Boomer lifespans into the eighties and beyond. They're the longest-lived generation in history, which gives them more time to enjoy what they've built—and more time to watch the world change into something their younger self wouldn't recognize.</p>"
