      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1953-1965</h2><p>You were born the year Stalin died and the Korean War finally ended. Eisenhower was three months into his presidency. Watson and Crick had just figured out the structure of DNA, which would eventually explain why you got your father's nose and your mother's temper. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood on top of Everest. The world was climbing toward something.</p><p>Your early years unfolded in the most prosperous period in American history. Your father probably worked one job that paid enough to buy a house, a car, and raise however many kids your parents decided to have. Your mother likely stayed home, at least until you started school. This was the template—not because it was the only way, but because it was affordable.</p><p>You grew up with the atom bomb as background noise. Duck and cover drills at school. Fallout shelters in the neighborhood. The Soviets had the bomb now too, and everyone acted like nuclear war was a scheduling conflict rather than an existential threat. You learned to live with apocalyptic dread before you learned long division.</p><p>Television arrived in your living room like a new family member nobody asked for. You were two when Disneyland opened. Five when Sputnik beeped its way across the sky and suddenly your teachers cared very much about science and math. Six when Castro took Cuba. Seven when four Black students sat at a Woolworth's lunch counter and refused to move.</p><p>Your childhood was the last gasp of a certain kind of innocence—or at least the illusion of it. The 1960s were coming, and they would rearrange everything you thought you knew about the country you lived in.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That makes you part of the largest generation in American history until the Millennials showed up and demanded attention. Your cohort is roughly 76 million people, the demographic tidal wave that reshaped every institution it touched.</p><p>You're the generation that was supposed to change everything—and did, though not always in the ways you intended. You protested Vietnam, marched for civil rights, questioned authority, grew your hair long, and then eventually cut it, bought houses, and voted for Reagan. The contradiction isn't hypocrisy; it's just what happens when idealism meets mortgage payments.</p><p>The defining moments for early Boomers like you were the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, and Watergate. You were ten when JFK was shot. You watched your parents cry. You were old enough for Vietnam to be your war—either you went, or you found a way not to, and both choices followed you forever.</p><p>Your generation invented youth culture as a market category. Before you, teenagers were just short adults. After you, they were a demographic with purchasing power and opinions. Rock and roll, blue jeans, muscle cars—these weren't just products, they were identity markers. You were the first generation to be sold to so aggressively, and you bought what they were selling.</p><p>Boomers get blamed for a lot now: the housing crisis, climate change, the general state of things. Some of it's fair. Most generations break a few things on their way through. Your generation just happened to be large enough that the breakage shows.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Playboy launched its first issue—Marilyn Monroe on the cover, a magazine that somehow convinced men they were buying it for the articles. That same year, Ian Fleming published the first James Bond novel, Casino Royale. Sex and violence wrapped in sophistication. The formula would print money for decades.</p><p>Television was still a novelty. I Love Lucy was the biggest show in the country. Your family probably got their first TV when you were a toddler, and suddenly the living room had a glowing center of gravity. Ed Sullivan. What's My Line. The Honeymooners. You learned to sit still and be quiet because something was on.</p><p>You were four when Elvis appeared on Ed Sullivan from the waist up. Five when West Side Story opened on Broadway. Ten when the Beatles landed at JFK and teenage girls learned how to scream in a way that worried their parents. Eleven when Bob Dylan went electric and folk purists acted like he'd burned the Constitution.</p><p>Your adolescence was soundtracked by Motown, the British Invasion, and the psychedelic weirdness that followed. You were fifteen during the Summer of Love. Seventeen when Woodstock happened—maybe you went, maybe you wished you had, maybe you're tired of people asking. By the time you were twenty, The Godfather had redefined American cinema and Watergate had redefined American cynicism.</p><p>The culture you grew up with was analog, tactile, shared. You watched the same three channels as everyone else. You bought albums and played them until the grooves wore out. Pop culture wasn't algorithmically personalized—it was communal, which meant you had things to talk about with strangers.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year a computer called UNIVAC correctly predicted Eisenhower's election victory on live television. Computers in 1953 filled entire rooms, cost millions, and had less processing power than the phone you carry now. Technology was something that happened at IBM, not in your kitchen.</p><p>The technological revolution of your childhood was television. Your family probably went from no TV to a black-and-white set to color TV over the course of your first two decades. The remote control arrived when you were a teenager—before that, someone had to get up and walk to the television like an animal.</p><p>You were sixteen when humans landed on the moon. You watched it happen on that same television, grainy footage of Armstrong's boot touching lunar dust. Technology could do anything, it seemed. The future was arriving on schedule.</p><p>You were in your thirties when the personal computer became a thing people actually bought. Your forties brought the internet, though it was mostly email and ugly websites at first. Your fifties brought smartphones. Your sixties brought social media, which let you reconnect with everyone from high school, whether you wanted to or not.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is immigrant, not native. You learned each new thing as it arrived, adapted, and moved on to the next. You've mastered more technological transitions than any generation before or since—from rotary phones to smartphones, from typewriters to touchscreens, from three channels to infinite streaming. The kids think you're slow with technology. They have no idea how many times you've started over from scratch.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were ten when Kennedy was assassinated. You remember where you were when you heard. Everyone your age remembers. It was the first time you understood that the world could change in a single afternoon, that the adults in charge didn't have everything under control.</p><p>You were twelve when the Civil Rights Act passed, thirteen when Selma happened, fifteen when Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. You watched the civil rights movement unfold in real time, on television, in ways your parents' generation never experienced. You saw fire hoses turned on children. You saw what your country was willing to do to maintain the status quo.</p><p>Vietnam was your generation's war. You were eighteen in 1971, draft age. Maybe you served. Maybe you protested. Maybe you did both at different times. The war ended when you were twenty-two, but it never really ended for the people who fought it or the country that sent them.</p><p>You were twenty-one when Nixon resigned. Watergate taught your generation that authority lies, that power corrupts, that the system isn't worthy of blind faith. This skepticism became core to who Boomers are—a generation that learned young not to trust anyone over thirty, then got over thirty and wondered why nobody trusted them.</p><p>You were thirty-six when the Berlin Wall fell. Forty-seven during 9/11. Fifty-five during the 2008 financial crisis. Sixty-seven when COVID hit. You've watched the world reorganize itself multiple times. The Cold War ended, then something else started. The Soviet threat disappeared, replaced by terrorism, then by other anxieties. History didn't stop—it just changed costumes.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the mid-1970s, which was not great timing. The post-war economic miracle was running out of steam. Stagflation—stagnant growth plus inflation—made economists question everything they thought they knew. Gas lines stretched around blocks. The optimism of the 1960s had curdled.</p><p>But you adapted, because that's what your generation does. You probably started with one company and stayed longer than anyone would now. Job loyalty was still expected. Pensions still existed. The deal was simple: you gave them decades, they gave you security. It seemed fair at the time.</p><p>Your career peaked during the longest economic expansion in American history—the 1990s boom that made everyone feel like a genius. The internet was going to change everything, and it did, mostly by making your company reorganize itself every eighteen months. You survived layoffs, mergers, acquisitions, and the discovery that 'synergy' was just a word MBAs used to justify firing people.</p><p>You were probably in a leadership position by 2008, which means you had to manage through the financial crisis, explaining to younger workers why there wouldn't be raises this year, or next year, or maybe ever. The irony wasn't lost on you—the economy that had rewarded your generation's loyalty was now punishing the next generation's ambition.</p><p>Retirement, if you've reached it, looks different than you planned. Social Security exists but doesn't cover everything. Your pension, if you have one, is a rare artifact. Your 401(k) took hits in 2000, 2008, and 2020. You're either still working by choice, still working by necessity, or figuring out how to make what you saved last longer than actuarial tables suggest you'll need it.</p>"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which sounds more fun than it actually was for most people. The Pill became available when you were a teenager. Social norms around sex, marriage, and gender roles shifted dramatically over your twenties. Your parents' rules didn't apply anymore, but nobody had written new ones yet.</p><p>You probably married younger than your kids will. Married young, possibly divorced young—your generation normalized divorce in ways previous generations hadn't. The stigma faded. The option existed. Sometimes staying together was the braver choice, and sometimes leaving was.</p><p>Communication in your lifetime went from letters to long-distance phone calls to email to text messages to video chats with grandchildren who live across the country. You've maintained relationships across every technology platform humans have invented. You know how to write a proper letter. You also know how to use emoji, even if your kids mock your choices.</p><p>Your generation pioneered dual-income households. Your wife probably worked, at least eventually, even if she wasn't supposed to according to the script your parents followed. The economics demanded it. The feminism encouraged it. The reality was more complicated—two careers, still one person doing most of the housework, the second shift that never ended.</p><p>You've been married to the same person for forty years, or you've been married three times, or you never married at all. Your generation broke the mold on what relationships had to look like, even as you struggled to figure out what you wanted them to be.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You grew up during the greatest economic expansion in human history. Houses were cheap. Education was cheap. A single income could support a family. This wasn't a fantasy—it was Tuesday. The abundance was so normal you didn't notice it until it was gone.</p><p>Your financial expectations were shaped by parents who survived the Depression. They saved obsessively, distrusted debt, kept cash in mattresses sometimes literally. You inherited their caution but lived in an economy that rewarded risk. You probably bought a house for what now seems like pocket change. You probably complain about avocado toast without realizing how that sounds.</p><p>You accumulated wealth the old-fashioned way: you showed up, you stayed, you waited. Company stock. Pension vesting. Property appreciation. The system was designed to reward patience, and you were patient. The system then changed, but you'd already gotten yours.</p><p>Your generation controls more wealth than any generation in history. This is not an exaggeration. Boomers hold roughly 52% of U.S. household wealth. Gen X has 27%. Millennials have 7%. The math explains a lot of the intergenerational tension—there's only so much pie, and you got the biggest slice before anyone else sat down.</p><p>Your financial anxiety, if you have it, is about preservation rather than acquisition. You're not trying to make your fortune. You're trying not to lose it. Healthcare costs. Long-term care. Leaving something for the kids versus spending it while you can still enjoy it. The decisions are different when you're protecting a pile rather than building one.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is the assumption that your path is still available. You bought a house on a single income, so why can't they? You paid for college with a summer job, so why are they complaining about debt? The economy that made your success possible has fundamentally changed, but the memory of how it used to work makes it hard to see how it works now.</p><p>You were taught that hard work equals success, which was mostly true for your generation and is mostly false now. The correlation held when there were enough jobs, affordable housing, and pensions. It doesn't hold when housing costs eight times median income and entry-level positions require five years of experience. You're not wrong that you worked hard. You're wrong that working hard is sufficient anymore.</p><p>Your generation normalized certain kinds of dysfunction that younger generations are trying to fix. Workaholism was a virtue, not a disorder. Mental health was something you didn't talk about. Racism and sexism were problems you either didn't see or didn't think were your responsibility. Progress happened despite resistance, and some of that resistance came from people who thought they were the good guys.</p><p>You're sometimes blind to your own collective power. Boomers vote in larger numbers than any other generation. You control boardrooms, courtrooms, and Congress. The policies that frustrate younger generations were often passed by people your age. The system isn't just broken—it's been designed to work for the people who designed it, and those people look a lot like you.</p><p>You've been told you're selfish so often that you've stopped listening, which is understandable but not helpful. Every generation is selfish. Yours just happened to be large enough, wealthy enough, and long-lived enough that the selfishness shows. The defensiveness is natural. The inability to hear criticism is expensive.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1973-1983):</strong> You graduated into stagflation and oil crises. Vietnam was ending. Watergate was unfolding. The idealism of the 1960s had crashed into the cynicism of the 1970s. You probably got married, probably started a career, probably bought a house for less than a new car costs now. The economy was rocky, but you were young and the fundamentals still worked.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1983-1993):</strong> Reagan was president, then Bush. The Cold War was ending. Wall Street was booming. You were building—career, family, wealth. Your kids were born in this decade, probably. The mortgage got paid down. The 401(k) got funded. You were doing what you were supposed to do, and it was working.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1993-2003):</strong> The Clinton years. The internet bubble. Your peak earning decade, probably. Your kids were teenagers, which was its own crisis. You were middle management or higher, making decisions that affected other people's livelihoods. The economy roared. Your portfolio grew. Y2K turned out to be nothing. Then 9/11 changed everything, though you were old enough by then that the change felt more like confirmation than revelation.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2003-2013):</strong> The Iraq War. The 2008 financial crisis. Your retirement plans took a hit, maybe a serious one. You watched younger colleagues get laid off first—seniority still meant something, but for how long? Your kids were leaving home, or trying to, or moving back because the economy cratered. You were supposed to be coasting toward retirement. Instead, you were recalculating.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2013-2023):</strong> The gig economy emerged. Your grandchildren were born. Technology kept accelerating past what you could comfortably follow. Retirement arrived, or didn't—some of you are still working at 70, by choice or necessity. The pandemic hit when you were 67, putting your generation at highest risk. You survived, mostly. The world kept spinning, differently than before.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2023+):</strong> This is now. You're managing health, legacy, purpose. Your generation is living longer than any before, which is a blessing and a logistical challenge. The world your grandchildren will inherit looks nothing like the one you grew up in. You have wisdom to offer, if anyone will listen. You have regrets, probably, but also accomplishments. The story isn't over until it's over.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.9 million people born in 1953. The entire Baby Boom generation is about 76 million Americans, the demographic elephant that reshaped every room it walked into for seven decades.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were louder, more rebellious, less deferential to authority. They fought World War II or grew up in its shadow. You grew up in the prosperity that followed and took it personally when it ended. They followed rules. You questioned them, loudly, then eventually wrote new rules that looked suspiciously similar.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had it easier economically and refuse to admit it. Gen X entered the workforce during recessions, watched pensions disappear, and never had the safety net you took for granted. They're cynical because they had to be. You're optimistic because optimism paid off for you.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. When Boomers were 35, you controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at 35 control 5%. You bought houses for three times your salary. They're paying eight times theirs. The economy that worked for you broke before they got there, and they're tired of being blamed for not thriving in wreckage.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. They've never known a world without internet, without school shootings, without climate anxiety. They're pragmatic in ways that look like pessimism to you. They don't expect the system to work because they've never seen it work. Your optimism looks like denial to them. Their realism looks like giving up to you.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 69 years. You've beaten that already. Modern medicine, better nutrition, and luck have extended Boomer lifespans well into the 80s for many. You're the longest-lived generation in history, which gives you more time to enjoy what you've built—and more time to watch the world change into something unrecognizable.</p>"
