      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1953-1965</h2><p>The smell of Brylcreem and your father's Lucky Strikes. The crinkle of wax paper around a bologna sandwich. The satisfying click of Tinkertoys snapping together on the living room floor. Your childhood had a texture that nobody born after 1970 will ever understand—everything was slower, smaller, safer. Or at least it felt that way.</p><p>The year you were born, Swanson invented the TV dinner. By the time you were three, your family probably had aluminum trays of turkey and mashed potatoes in front of the Dumont, watching Howdy Doody or The Lone Ranger. Your mother served Jell-O salads with things suspended in them that had no business being in Jell-O. Cream cheese and pineapple. Shredded carrots. This was considered elegant.</p><p>At four, you got your first taste of the new world: Disneyland opened in 1957. At five, Sputnik beeped across the night sky, and suddenly your teachers cared very much about science and math. You did duck-and-cover drills, crouching under wooden desks as if plywood could stop an atom bomb. You practiced for the apocalypse between spelling tests.</p><p>Your toys were built to last—and occasionally to injure. Erector Sets with actual sharp metal edges. Cap guns with roll caps that smelled like sulfur and summer. Lincoln Logs for building, Silly Putty for pressing against newspaper comics and watching the ink transfer. You had Slinky before they made it plastic, when it was heavy enough to actually hurt someone.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant walking to the Woolworth's lunch counter with a dime for a cherry Coke, then catching a double feature at the movie palace downtown—the kind with velvet seats and a balcony. At seven, you watched the Greensboro sit-ins on television and didn't fully understand what you were seeing. At nine, you watched a man orbit the Earth. At ten, a president was shot in Dallas, and nothing ever felt quite as simple again.</p><p>Your parents remembered the Depression. They remembered rationing, Victory Gardens, gold-star mothers. They raised you in abundance specifically because they'd known scarcity. You got Schwinn bicycles and Roy Rogers lunch boxes and a childhood that assumed the future would be even better. They couldn't have known what was coming.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The word sounds quaint now, like something from a sociology textbook. But you were the first generation named as a demographic phenomenon, the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans born between 1946 and 1964 who became a tidal wave reshaping everything they touched—schools, then colleges, then the job market, then the housing market, then Medicare.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were ten when Kennedy was assassinated. Sitting in a fifth-grade classroom, probably, when the principal's voice came over the intercom.</span> You watched Walter Cronkite take off his glasses and announce the president was dead. You watched your parents cry—maybe the first time you'd seen that. You learned, in a single November afternoon, that the adults weren't actually in charge of anything.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964, which means you share a label with people born when you were already in sixth grade. The early Boomers—your cohort—are different from the late ones. You remember the before times: the optimism of Eisenhower's America, the belief that problems had solutions, the confidence that the future would be better. Late Boomers were born into Vietnam and Watergate. You remember what we lost.</p><p>At eleven, you watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan with 73 million other Americans. At fifteen, you were old enough to understand what Vietnam meant but too young to go. At eighteen, in 1971, the draft was still active, and every birthday was a lottery you hoped to lose. Some of your friends went. Some didn't come back. Some came back different. This was your war, whether you fought in it or not.</p><p>Your generation invented the teenager as a market category. Before Boomers, adolescence was just a waiting room for adulthood. You turned it into a culture—blue jeans, rock records, muscle cars, rebellion as a brand. Madison Avenue noticed. They've been selling youth back to young people ever since, but you were the original target demographic.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">Now you're blamed for everything from the housing crisis to climate change to the general state of things. Some of it's fair. You did vote for the policies that got us here.</span> But every generation breaks what it touches. Yours was just large enough that the breakage shows. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, I Love Lucy was the number-one show in America. Lucille Ball was pregnant on television, which was considered scandalous—they couldn't say the word 'pregnant,' so they said 'expecting.' That same year, Ian Fleming published Casino Royale, inventing James Bond. Playboy launched with Marilyn Monroe on the cover. The culture you'd inherit was already being assembled.</p><p>Your early TV diet was The Mickey Mouse Club, Howdy Doody, and Captain Kangaroo. You knew every word of 'M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E' before you could spell your own name. The Lone Ranger taught you that good guys wore white. Dragnet taught you that crime didn't pay. Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang about happy trails while you ate Cheerios from a Roy Rogers cereal bowl.</p><p>At three, Davy Crockett hit the airwaves, and suddenly every kid in America needed a coonskin cap. Your parents probably stood in line at Sears to buy you one. At four, Elvis Presley appeared on Ed Sullivan, shot from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous for America. Your parents thought rock and roll was noise. You thought it was the future.</p><p>At eleven, the Beatles landed at JFK, and you watched teenage girls scream so hard they fainted. You were thirteen when the British Invasion hit full force—Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks. You argued with friends about whether the Beatles or the Stones were better. (This argument is still unresolved.) At fourteen, Bob Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at Newport and folk purists booed like he'd betrayed them personally.</p><p>Your adolescence was Motown and psychedelia. Martha and the Vandellas. The Supremes in matching sequined dresses. Then Sgt. Pepper's dropped when you were fourteen, and music became something you studied, not just heard. At sixteen, you were watching 2001: A Space Odyssey in theaters, trying to figure out what the monolith meant. At seventeen, Woodstock happened. Maybe you were there; maybe you wished you were; maybe you're tired of being asked.</p><p>At nineteen, The Godfather changed American cinema—suddenly movies could be art and entertainment simultaneously. At twenty, American Graffiti made you nostalgic for a childhood you'd only just left. The culture you grew up with was shared. Three networks. Top 40 radio. Everyone watched the same thing, argued about the same thing, sang the same songs at the same parties. You had a common language that doesn't exist anymore.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year you were born, UNIVAC predicted Eisenhower's election victory on live television—a computer the size of a room, doing calculations that your phone could now handle in a microsecond. Computers were science fiction. Technology was something that happened at Bell Labs and IBM, not in your house. Your house had a rotary phone on the wall and maybe a Philco radio in the living room. That was high tech.</p><p>At one, your family probably got their first television—a hulking wooden cabinet with a screen the size of a porthole, picking up three channels if the antenna was pointed right. You grew up adjusting rabbit ears and thumping the side of the set when the picture rolled. At five, you watched the first color broadcast, though you probably didn't see it in color—that came later. At seven, the transistor radio arrived, and suddenly music was portable. You could listen to Elvis in your bedroom without your parents knowing.</p><p>At four, Sputnik beeped across the night sky, and America panicked. The Soviets were ahead. You were part of the generation that would have to catch up. At sixteen, you watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon—grainy footage on a television that still needed a moment to warm up. Humans on the moon. It felt like the beginning of something infinite.</p><p>You learned to type on manual typewriters, the kind where you could feel the resistance of each key, where mistakes meant correction ribbon or starting over. You used carbon paper to make copies. You looked things up in encyclopedias, which were obsolete before you finished paying for them. You calculated with slide rules before calculators made them antiques.</p><p>At thirty-two, the personal computer arrived—the Apple II, then the IBM PC. At forty-two, the World Wide Web launched, though it took another few years before you understood what it was. At forty-eight, Google appeared. At fifty-one, the iPod. At fifty-four, the iPhone changed everything, putting a computer in your pocket that would have seemed like magic in 1953.</p><p>You've survived more technological disruptions than any generation in history. Vinyl to cassette to CD to streaming. Film to digital. Letters to email to texts to whatever the kids are using now. You're not slow with technology—you're exhausted by it. You've had to relearn how the world works every decade. The young people who mock your texting speed have no idea how many times you've started over from scratch.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At ten, Kennedy was assassinated—November 22, 1963. Where were you when you heard?</span> The historical cascade that followed: the escalation in Vietnam, the Civil Rights Act passage, the long decade of marches, riots, and assassinations that transformed America.</p><p>At eleven, you watched the Civil Rights Act pass. At twelve, you saw the marchers in Selma beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge—the footage played on the evening news, and even in living rooms far from Alabama, people had to reckon with what they were seeing. At fifteen, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy. Cities burned. It felt like the country was tearing itself apart. Maybe it was.</p><p>Vietnam was your war. You were eighteen in 1971, draft-eligible, watching the lottery balls spin on television. Your number could have sent you to a jungle on the other side of the world, or not. Some of your friends went. Some protested. Some did both. At twenty-two, you watched the helicopters lift off from the Saigon embassy roof—the end of a war that had defined your adolescence, though the men who fought it are still fighting something.</p><p>At twenty-one, you watched Nixon resign. Watergate taught your generation what the younger ones already suspected: that authority lies, that power corrupts, that the system is not worthy of blind faith. 'I am not a crook' became a punchline. You learned not to trust anyone over thirty, then turned thirty and wondered why no one trusted you.</p><p>At thirty-six, you watched the Berlin Wall come down. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The Cold War that had shadowed your entire life—the duck-and-cover drills, the Cuban Missile Crisis when you were nine and thought the world might actually end—was suddenly over.</span> You watched crowds dancing on the rubble and wondered what came next.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> The Pentagon in flames. A field in Pennsylvania. You were old enough to contextualize it, to know that this was a pivot point, but also old enough to have seen pivot points before. At fifty-five, the financial system collapsed. At sixty-seven, a pandemic shut down the world, and your age group was the most vulnerable. You've lived through more 'unprecedented' events than most generations see in multiple lifetimes. The word has lost its meaning.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about timing. You graduated into the 1970s economy—stagflation, oil embargoes, gas lines snaking around blocks. The post-war miracle that had employed your fathers was sputtering. But here's the thing: the fundamentals still worked. A company would hire you. Train you. Keep you. Give you a pension at the end. The deal was brutal by today's standards—you gave them forty years, they gave you a gold watch—but it was a deal. That deal doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>You probably started at one company and stayed, or maybe two. Job-hopping was for losers. Loyalty was a value, not a liability. Your business card meant something—not just a title, but membership in an institution. You climbed the ladder rung by rung because that was the only direction the ladder went. Meritocracy was flawed, but it existed as a concept people believed in.</p><p>Women of your generation entered the workforce in numbers that terrified and confused the men already there. If you're a woman who worked in the 1970s and 80s, you know what it cost: the comments, the assumptions, the glass ceiling nobody admitted existed. You wore power suits with shoulder pads like armor. You were twice as good to be considered half as qualified. Some of you broke through. Many were broken by the effort.</p><p>Your peak earning years coincided with the longest economic expansion in American history—the Clinton-era boom when the stock market seemed incapable of going down. You had a corner office, or at least an office with a door. You had a secretary, then an assistant, then a shared admin pool, then Microsoft Outlook and the expectation that you'd handle your own calendar. The technology kept changing your job description.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and you had to deliver the bad news.</span> Layoffs. Pension freezes. The 'new normal' speeches that nobody believed. You managed kids who'd been promised everything and received rubble. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The irony—that the system had rewarded your loyalty and was now punishing their ambition—wasn't lost on anyone.</span></p><p>Retirement, if you've reached it, looks nothing like the brochure. Social Security exists but doesn't cover what it should. Your 401(k) took hits in 2000, 2008, and 2020. You're either still working by choice, still working by necessity, or doing careful math about how long your savings have to last. The finish line keeps moving.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when getting someone's phone number meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer? When a date meant being picked up at the door, meeting the parents, being home by midnight? When 'going steady' was declared with a class ring on a chain around her neck? The rules were rigid, but at least they were clear.</p><p>The Pill was approved when you were seven. By the time you were dating, it had changed everything—or at least the possibility of everything. The sexual revolution sounds more liberated than it felt for most people. New freedoms came with new confusions. Your parents' scripts no longer applied, but nobody had written replacements. You figured it out as you went, often badly.</p><p>You probably married younger than your children will—mid-twenties was typical, early twenties not unusual. The wedding was at the church your family attended. The reception was in the fellowship hall, not a destination venue. You got a toaster, a blender, a set of dishes. You set up house on furniture your parents gave you or you bought at Sears on layaway.</p><p>Your generation normalized divorce. Before Boomers, marriage was essentially permanent—stigma kept people trapped in misery. You gave yourself permission to leave. California's no-fault divorce law passed when you were sixteen. By the time you were thirty, half the marriages around you were ending. Sometimes staying was brave. Sometimes leaving was braver. The judgment eased, slowly.</p><p>If you're a woman, you negotiated the impossible math of your generation: career expectations rising just as you started a family, domestic labor still falling disproportionately on you. The 'second shift' wasn't a phrase yet, but you lived it. Working all day, then working all evening. Your husband 'helped out' in language that told you everything.</p><p>You've maintained relationships across every communication technology humans have invented. Love letters in cursive. Long-distance calls that cost a dollar a minute, so you watched the clock while your heart raced. Email, then texts, then video calls with grandchildren across the country. You know how to write a proper thank-you note. You also know how to use FaceTime, even if the angle isn't flattering.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Here are the numbers, because the numbers tell the story. When you were thirty, in 1983, the median home price was <span class=\"stat-box\">$70,000</span>—about 2.8 times the median household income. Today it's over six times. When you graduated college—if you went—tuition at a state university was about <span class=\"stat-box\">$500 a year</span>. Adjusted for inflation, that's roughly $3,500. Current average: <span class=\"stat-box\">$11,000</span>. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Your children's children will need six-figure debt for what cost you a summer job.</span></p><p>Your parents survived the Depression. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They saved obsessively, distrusted banks, kept cash in coffee cans. They bought one house and stayed in it forever. They wore clothes until they wore out.</span> This caution was passed to you—but you inherited it alongside an economy that rewarded spending. Easy credit. Rising home values. A pension at the end of the rainbow. You were taught to save and lived in a world that paid you to borrow.</p><p>You bought your first house for what now sounds like a typo. Maybe $40,000 in the mid-1970s. That house appreciated while you slept. You didn't do anything—you just showed up and waited. The system was designed to reward patience, and you were patient. The system then changed, but you'd already gotten yours.</p><p>Your financial timeline benefited from being in the right place at the right time. Houses appreciated while you held mortgages. Markets rose over the decades you invested. The basic math of compound interest, applied over forty years, created wealth without requiring genius—just patience and presence. Time in the market matters, and you had the time.</p><p>Your current financial concerns have shifted from building to preserving. Healthcare costs that can consume savings rapidly. The uncertainty of how long retirement needs to last when life expectancy keeps extending. The calculations change when you're protecting accumulated wealth rather than creating it.</p><p>Your financial anxiety now is about preservation, not acquisition. Healthcare costs that can bankrupt a family. Long-term care that costs more than most people earn. The calculation of how much to leave the kids versus how much to spend while you can still enjoy it. The math is different when you're protecting a pile instead of building one.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your biggest blind spot is survivorship bias—the natural human tendency to assume that what worked for you represents a universal truth rather than a historical moment. Your experience was real. The conditions that made it possible were specific to your era. Separating the two requires conscious effort.</p><p>You were taught that hard work correlates with success. For your generation, the correlation was strong enough to feel like causation. The relationship between effort and outcome varies by era, by circumstance, by factors beyond individual control. Recognizing that doesn't diminish your achievements—it contextualizes them. Context is what wisdom looks like.</p><p>You normalized dysfunction that younger generations are now trying to name. Workaholism wasn't a disorder—it was a virtue. Burning out meant you were committed. Staying late was dedication. Mental health was weakness; therapy was self-indulgent; needing help was failure. You wore these beliefs like badges and passed them to your children, who are now paying therapists to undo the damage.</p><p>Your generation is sometimes blind to its collective power precisely because you experienced it as individual effort. You worked hard; you succeeded; therefore work causes success. But individual effort occurred within collective systems—tax policies, regulations, environmental decisions. The choices your generation made, voting booth by voting booth, shaped the landscape everyone navigates. That's not accusation; it's just how democracy works. Every generation inherits the previous one's decisions and makes its own.</p><p>Boomers vote in larger numbers than any other generation. You control boardrooms, courtrooms, legislatures, and homeowner associations. The policies younger generations find frustrating were written by people who look like you. The system isn't just broken—it was designed to work for the people who designed it. That's not conspiracy; it's how power works.</p><p>You've been called selfish so often that you've stopped hearing it, which is understandable. Every generation is selfish. Yours just happened to be large enough, wealthy enough, and long-lived enough that the selfishness shows. The defensiveness is natural. The inability to receive feedback is expensive—not for you, but for everyone who comes after.</p>"

Nixon resigned when you were twenty-one. Stagflation made economists question everything. Gas lines stretched around blocks; you waited with an empty tank and thought about rationing stories your parents told. But you were young, and the fundamentals still worked. You got hired. You got married—mid-twenties, probably. You bought a house for what now sounds fictional. The economy stumbled, but you kept your footing.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1983-1993):</strong> Morning in America, if you believed the slogans. Reagan, then Bush. The Cold War ending in slow motion—Gorbachev, glasnost, words that had to be explained. Your kids were born in this decade. The minivan replaced the muscle car. You coached Little League, helped with homework, wondered where your twenties went. Your career climbed steadily. Your pension vested. Your house appreciated. You were doing what the script demanded, and the script was working.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1993-2003):</strong> The Clinton boom years. The internet arrived, first as curiosity, then as revolution. You got your first email address at work. Your company reorganized itself every eighteen months to capture 'synergy.' You survived layoffs, mergers, acquisitions. Your kids became teenagers, which was its own kind of crisis. The stock market doubled, then doubled again. Your 401(k) looked like magic. Then planes hit buildings, and you watched your second impossible thing on television, nearly forty years after the first.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2003-2013):</strong> Iraq. Afghanistan. The forever wars your generation's children fought. At fifty-five, the financial system collapsed, and your retirement timeline shattered. The portfolio that looked like enough wasn't enough. Your kids graduated into rubble—the worst job market since the Depression. They moved back home, or needed help with rent, or couldn't buy houses the way you had. You wondered if you'd failed them somehow. The math said otherwise, but guilt doesn't do math.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2013-2023):</strong> The long goodbye to work, whether you wanted it or not. Some of you retired on schedule. Some were pushed out early. Some keep working because the alternative doesn't cover healthcare. Your grandchildren arrived, giving everything new meaning. Then COVID hit when you were sixty-seven—your age group most vulnerable, locked down longest, losing friends to a virus that picked its targets with cruel precision. You survived. Many did. Not everyone.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2023+):</strong> This is now. You're managing health with more attention than ever—doctors' appointments, prescriptions, the awareness that the body is finite. Your generation is living longer than any before, which is miracle and burden simultaneously. The world your grandchildren will inherit looks nothing like the one you entered. You have wisdom to offer, though nobody seems interested in hearing it. You have regrets, of course. But also: a life that mattered, work that meant something, people who love you. The story ends when it ends. Not yet.</p>"

Every institution you touched had to expand to accommodate you, then figure out what to do when you moved on.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They survived the Depression and won World War II. They followed rules because rules had kept them alive. You inherited their prosperity and questioned their obedience. They worked quietly; you demanded to be heard. They saved for rainy days; you assumed the weather would hold. You called them conformist. They called you ungrateful. Both had points.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The forgotten middle child of generations. They entered the workforce during recessions you'd helped create. They watched pensions disappear before they could vest. They were too young for Woodstock, too old for the internet boom. They're cynical because cynicism was survival. You're optimistic because optimism paid off. The gap between those attitudes maps almost perfectly onto the gap in net worth.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap is the headline.</span> When Boomers were in their forties, your generation controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age control 7%. You bought houses for three times your salary. They're looking at six to eight times theirs—if they can look at all.

Different circumstances, different outcomes.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You might as well be from different planets. They've never known a world without internet, without school shooting drills, without climate anxiety as background noise. They don't expect the system to work because they've never seen it work. Your optimism looks like denial to them. Their pragmatism looks like giving up to you. Neither is entirely wrong.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Your generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Your life expectancy at birth was sixty-nine years.

You're the longest-lived generation in history, which gives you more time to enjoy what you've built—and more time to watch the world change into something your younger self wouldn't recognize.</p>"
