      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year Germany reunified and Nelson Mandela walked free after 27 years in prison. The Berlin Wall had just fallen. The Soviet Union was in its death spiral. History was accelerating, and you were busy learning to hold your head up.</p><p>Your childhood coincided almost perfectly with the Clinton administration. You were two when Bill Clinton won the presidency, twelve when the Monica Lewinsky scandal consumed every adult conversation you weren't supposed to hear. The economy boomed while you were in elementary school. Your parents probably felt optimistic in ways they wouldn't again for decades.</p><p>You were the last cohort to have a fully analog early childhood. No iPads in the minivan. No YouTube to babysit you. Your entertainment was whatever was on the three TV channels that came in clearly, plus maybe cable if your family sprung for it. Boredom was a regular experience. You learned to fill time without a screen because screens weren't portable yet.</p><p>You were four when Princess Diana died—old enough to notice the adults were upset, too young to understand why. You were nine when Columbine happened. Your school probably started doing lockdown drills after that. The phrase 'active shooter' entered your vocabulary before puberty.</p><p>You were eleven on September 11, 2001. Old enough to watch the towers fall, to understand that people were dying, to feel the fear in the room. Young enough that the post-9/11 world became your normal. You don't really remember what airports were like before you had to take your shoes off. You grew up assuming that constant surveillance was just how the world worked.</p><p>Technology arrived in waves during your childhood. Your family's first computer probably showed up when you were six or seven. The internet came a year or two later—dialup that made that screeching noise and kicked everyone off the phone. You were twelve when the first iPod launched, fifteen when YouTube went online, seventeen when the iPhone changed everything. You caught the full transition from analog to digital, which makes you bilingual in ways younger people aren't.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Dances with Wolves won Best Picture and Pretty Woman turned Julia Roberts into America's sweetheart. Kevin McCallister got left home alone. The Simpsons started its run as a full series—it would outlast your childhood, your adolescence, your twenties, and show no signs of stopping.</p><p>Musically, {{BIRTH_YEAR}} was the hinge between decades. MC Hammer told everyone they couldn't touch this. Vanilla Ice was ripping off Queen basslines. Madonna was voguing. Sinead O'Connor tore up a photo of the Pope and became either a hero or a villain depending on who you asked. Hair metal was dying. Grunge was about to be born.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack was peak '90s: Nirvana, then the Spice Girls, then boy bands, then Britney. You probably had strong opinions about Backstreet Boys versus NSYNC. You definitely had a Discman that skipped every time you walked. MTV still played music videos. TRL was appointment television. You learned what 'number one' meant by watching Carson Daly count down.</p><p>TV in your formative years was Friends, Seinfeld, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Saturday mornings were Nickelodeon—Rugrats, Doug, Hey Arnold. After school was Cartoon Network—Dexter's Lab, Johnny Bravo, Powerpuff Girls. You watched TV on a schedule because DVR didn't exist yet. If you missed an episode, you waited for reruns or heard about it secondhand.</p><p>Your middle school years coincided with the Harry Potter phenomenon. You were eleven when the first book came out in the US—the same age as Harry. You probably felt like the series was written for you specifically, because demographically, it was. You grew up alongside those characters, aging in sync with each book release.</p><p>By high school, you'd transitioned to MySpace, then Facebook. Your early internet presence is probably embarrassing—dramatic away messages on AIM, angsty LiveJournal posts, a MySpace profile with an auto-playing song that drove visitors insane. You learned to curate an online identity before anyone taught you why that might be important.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. The Hubble Space Telescope launched. The first GPS satellites went operational. The technological infrastructure that would define your life was being built while you were learning to crawl.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is unique because you remember both sides of the digital divide. You know what it's like to research a school paper using actual books in an actual library. You also know what it's like to have the entire sum of human knowledge available in your pocket. You're fluent in both worlds.</p><p>You were five when Windows 95 came out. Your family probably got a computer within a year or two of that—a beige tower with a CRT monitor that weighed forty pounds. You learned to type on a physical keyboard, navigate with a ball mouse, and wait patiently while pages loaded over dialup.</p><p>You were eight when Google launched. Before that, finding things online required AltaVista, Yahoo directories, or Ask Jeeves. The concept of 'just Google it' didn't exist. Neither did the expectation that all information should be instantly accessible. You remember when not knowing something was just a normal state of being.</p><p>You were eleven when the iPod debuted. You were probably still burning CDs or downloading music from Napster. The idea that you could carry a thousand songs in your pocket seemed miraculous. The idea that you'd eventually carry millions of songs, plus every movie ever made, plus a supercomputer, in the same pocket? Unimaginable.</p><p>You were fifteen when YouTube launched, sixteen when Twitter went public, seventeen when the iPhone dropped. That last one changed everything. Within three years, smartphones were everywhere. Within five years, they were mandatory. You watched the transition happen in real-time. You remember life before constant connectivity. You also remember exactly when that life ended.</p><p>This makes you an interpreter between generations. You can troubleshoot your parents' router and explain to your younger cousins why everyone's so upset about privacy. You understand both the promise and the threat of technology because you've lived through both. You're optimistic enough to see the benefits, cynical enough to see the costs.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born into a world being rapidly remade. The Cold War ended before you could walk. Germany reunified. The Soviet Union collapsed eighteen months after your birth. Your parents grew up with nuclear annihilation as a real possibility. You grew up wondering what all the fallout shelters were for.</p><p>The Gulf War started when you were six months old. It was the first war televised in real-time—CNN's ratings soared. Your parents probably watched the night-vision footage of bombs falling on Baghdad. You don't remember it, but it set the template for how America would conduct and consume war for the next three decades.</p><p>You were four when the Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people. You were seven when Princess Diana died and the world watched her funeral. You were nine when Columbine happened—the school shooting that became a template for all the school shootings after. Your generation normalized lockdown drills. That wasn't a feature of childhood before you.</p><p>You were eleven on September 11, 2001. You probably watched the second plane hit live. You definitely remember the confusion, the fear, the way the adults in your life suddenly seemed unsure about everything. The wars that followed—Afghanistan, then Iraq—became background noise for your entire adolescence. You can't remember a time when America wasn't at war somewhere.</p><p>You were eighteen when the 2008 financial crisis hit. You were probably applying to college, or already there, watching the economy collapse in real-time. The job market you expected to enter evaporated. The life trajectory your parents planned for you became a fantasy. This wasn't a speed bump—it was a fundamental reordering of what was possible.</p><p>You were twenty-five when marriage equality became the law. You were twenty-six when Donald Trump won the presidency. You were thirty when COVID-19 shut down the world. You've lived through more 'once in a lifetime' events than any generation since the World Wars. At a certain point, crisis stops being the exception and becomes the norm. You're there.</p><p>The through-line of your life has been watching certainties dissolve. The stable economy your parents expected? Gone. The peaceful world order? Fraying. The career ladder, the housing market, the social contract? Rewritten, usually in ways that benefit people older than you. You've adapted because the alternative was despair. But the adaptation has a cost.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated college around 2012, which was better than graduating in 2008 but still not great. The economy had technically recovered. The job market had not. You probably took a position you were overqualified for, worked harder than anyone told you the job would require, and got praised for your 'work ethic' instead of getting paid what you were worth.</p><p>Your generation entered the workforce right as the rules were changing. Pensions were already extinct. Job security was a quaint concept from your parents' era. The gig economy was being sold as 'flexibility' and 'entrepreneurship' when it was really just 'we don't want to pay for your health insurance.' You adapted because you had no choice.</p><p>You've probably had more jobs by thirty than your parents had in their entire careers. Not because you're disloyal—because companies stopped being loyal first. You watched colleagues get laid off two weeks after company-wide emails about 'our people are our greatest asset.' You learned early that corporate promises mean nothing.</p><p>Remote work became normalized during COVID, which was probably the one good thing to come from the pandemic. You proved you could do your job from anywhere, which employers interpreted as 'you can do your job from everywhere, all the time, including weekends and vacations.' The boundaries between work and life didn't blur—they dissolved.</p><p>Your career has been shaped by economic trauma in ways that don't always serve you. You're good at doing more with less. You're terrible at asking for raises because the implicit threat of unemployment hangs over every negotiation. You've internalized scarcity even when you're no longer scarce.</p><p>Side hustles aren't a lifestyle choice for your generation—they're a survival strategy. One income stream isn't enough when housing costs 40% of your salary and healthcare costs whatever they want to charge. You learned to diversify your income the way previous generations diversified their stock portfolios. It's exhausting. It's also mandatory.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were ten when the dot-com bubble burst. Eighteen during the 2008 financial crisis. Thirty during the COVID economic collapse. You've watched the economy implode three times before turning thirty-five. This has shaped your relationship with money in ways that don't always make sense to people who haven't lived through the same crises.</p><p>You save compulsively because you've seen how fast stability vanishes. You also spend impulsively because what's the point of saving when the goalposts keep moving? You're simultaneously frugal and fatalistic. You'll skip the latte but splurge on a vacation because the house you're saving for costs twice what it did five years ago and will cost twice that again in another five.</p><p>Student loan debt is probably a significant part of your financial reality. The average Millennial with student loans owes around $40,000. The payments stretch for decades. The interest accrues faster than you can pay it down. The promise was that education would pay for itself. The promise was a lie.</p><p>Homeownership, for your generation, is either a fantasy or a catastrophically expensive reality. The median home price is now over eight times the median income. Your parents bought houses for two or three times their annual salary. You're being asked to spend a decade's worth of wages. The math doesn't work unless you inherited money, which most of you didn't.</p><p>You've been lectured about avocado toast by people who bought their houses before you were born. The generational wealth gap is the largest it's ever been. Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth when they were your age. Millennials control about 7%. You're not bad with money. The money is bad with you.</p><p>Your financial strategy, such as it is, involves hedging against disaster while trying not to let anxiety paralyze you entirely. You invest because you don't trust Social Security to exist when you're seventy. You save because you've seen what happens when you don't have an emergency fund. You spend because denying yourself everything won't make the house more affordable. It's a balancing act performed on a tightrope that someone keeps shaking.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You graduated into the long tail of the Great Recession. The entry-level jobs required experience you couldn't get without entry-level jobs. You probably moved for work, or moved back home, or did both in sequence. This was supposed to be your decade of exploration and self-discovery. Instead, it was your decade of figuring out how to survive an economy that didn't want you. You made it work. You always make it work. But the making it work came at a cost.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> You're here now. You've probably accumulated some stability—better salary, clearer career direction, maybe a partner, maybe kids. But the stability feels fragile in ways previous generations didn't experience. You're one medical emergency, one layoff, one economic crisis away from losing ground. You're building on sand while trying not to think about the tide coming in.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> This should be your peak earning decade. You'll have institutional authority, professional expertise, the kind of leverage that only comes from experience. But you'll also be sandwiched—aging parents who need care, kids who need support, a body that's starting to negotiate rather than just comply. This is the decade where you either consolidate the gains of your thirties or pivot entirely. Most people don't pivot. Most people should consider it.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> By now you'll have survived at least four major economic crises, a pandemic (possibly two), and whatever fresh disasters the intervening years produce. You'll be pre-retirement age but probably unable to retire. The goalposts will have moved again. You'll be mentoring younger people who don't understand why you flinch whenever someone says 'economic downturn.' You'll have wisdom. You'll also have exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_START}}+):</strong> Retirement, if it happens, won't look like your parents' retirement. Full Social Security benefits won't be available until you're sixty-seven, and the program may be restructured before you get there. You'll probably work longer than you planned. You'll probably be okay with that, partly because you like working, partly because you have no choice. The world you'll retire into will be unrecognizable from the one you were born into. You'll tell younger people what life was like before the internet, before smartphones, before the climate changed. They'll have trouble believing you.</p>"
