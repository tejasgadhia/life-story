      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year Obama was re-elected and Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars. The last year of Gen Z. The tail end of a generation that was already being shaped by smartphones, social media, and screens everywhere. You never knew a world without them.</p><p>Your childhood was the 2010s—a decade of relative stability after the 2008 crisis, punctuated by mass shootings, political polarization, and creeping climate anxiety. You grew up in the shadow of adults' fears, absorbing their worries without fully understanding them.</p><p>You were eight during the 2020 pandemic. Third grade, maybe, when schools shut down and everything went remote. You learned to read on Zoom. You missed field trips, birthday parties, playdates. The social skills kids usually develop at your age got scrambled by quarantine. That's not your fault, but it's your reality.</p><p>Technology wasn't new to you; it was the air you breathed. iPads in preschool. YouTube Kids. Tablets as babysitters. Your parents might have tried to limit screen time, but screens were everywhere, and fighting them was exhausting. You grew up networked in ways no previous generation was.</p><p>You're still a kid as this is written. Your childhood is ongoing, which makes describing it strange—like trying to paint a moving target. Whatever your childhood becomes, it's already been shaped by pandemic disruption, climate awareness, and a political landscape that's more fractured than anything previous generations experienced at your age.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year The Avengers assembled and Gangnam Style broke YouTube. The Hunger Games was in theaters. One Direction was everywhere. Pop culture in 2012 was peak pre-pandemic mainstream—the last gasp of shared cultural moments before algorithms fragmented everything.</p><p>Your childhood entertainment was YouTube and streaming. You probably don't remember a world of scheduled TV—everything was on demand, always available, competing for your attention. Algorithms learned what you liked before you did.</p><p>Frozen came out when you were one. You don't remember a world before 'Let It Go' was everywhere. Disney+ launched when you were seven. Marvel movies were the constants of your childhood—a new superhero film every few months, each one promising to change everything.</p><p>Your childhood was Fortnite and Roblox, TikTok and Among Us. Games that were also social networks, entertainment that was also community. The line between playing and watching blurred until it disappeared entirely.</p><p>The pop culture you're growing up with is personalized by algorithm. You might share memes with friends, but you don't share a monoculture with your whole generation the way previous generations did. Everyone's feed is different. Everyone's cultural experience is unique. Whether that's good or bad, no one knows yet.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born into a world where iPhones already existed, where social media was already dominant, where the internet was already everywhere. There was no 'before' for you. Technology is just how the world works.</p><p>You were five when you probably first used a tablet. Six or seven when you might have gotten your own device. Screens have been part of your consciousness for as long as you can remember. Digital isn't a skill you learned; it's a native language.</p><p>You were eight when COVID forced everything online. School, socialization, entertainment—all of it mediated through screens. You spent formative years interacting with the world through rectangles of light. That's shaped you in ways we won't fully understand for decades.</p><p>AI is arriving as you come of age. ChatGPT launched when you were ten. By the time you're in high school, AI will be writing essays, generating images, transforming what it means to create. The skills you'll need for adulthood might not exist yet. The jobs you'll have might not exist yet.</p><p>Your relationship with technology will be the defining question of your life. You're the first generation that literally cannot remember existence without smartphones and social media. Whether you control these tools or they control you is a question every generation asks—but for you, the stakes are higher. The tools are more powerful. The attention economy is more sophisticated. Good luck.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were four when Trump was elected. You don't remember a time when American politics wasn't completely broken. The polarization that shocks older people is just normal to you. This is how it's always been, as far as you know.</p><p>You were six when Parkland happened. Kids only slightly older than you were dying in school, then getting on TV to demand change. Active shooter drills were already part of your school experience. You've grown up knowing that school isn't entirely safe, which is a thing no child should have to know.</p><p>You were eight when COVID hit. Your childhood was interrupted in ways that will shape you for decades. You missed years of normal development—social skills, classroom learning, the unstructured play that kids need. You've spent your entire memory of being a kid in a world dealing with pandemic aftermath.</p><p>Climate change isn't abstract to you. Wildfires, hurricanes, heat waves—extreme weather has been normal your whole life. The adults keep talking about preventing something that's already happening. You're inheriting a planet in crisis and you know it.</p><p>By the time you're an adult, the world will be unrecognizable. AI will have transformed work. Climate change will have transformed geography. Politics will have transformed in ways no one can predict. You're growing up in the interregnum between the old world and whatever comes next.</p>"

The jobs that will exist when you enter the workforce might not exist yet. The skills that will matter might not be teachable yet.</p><p>By the time you graduate college around {{COLLEGE_GRADUATION_YEAR}}, AI will have transformed most knowledge work. Writing, coding, analysis—tasks that used to require years of training might be automated. Your value will be in what machines can't do, whatever that turns out to be.</p><p>The gig economy will likely be even more dominant. Traditional employment with benefits might be rare. You'll probably have multiple income streams, multiple careers, multiple identities. Flexibility won't be a perk; it'll be survival.</p><p>Climate change will shape which industries exist and which cities are viable. Coastal flooding, extreme heat, water scarcity—these aren't future problems. They're current problems that will get worse. Your career will need to navigate a physically changing planet.</p><p>The advice older people give you about careers might be useless. The world they built their careers in is disappearing. You'll need to figure it out as you go, which is terrifying and also kind of freeing. No one knows what works anymore, which means you get to experiment.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial psychology is still forming. You're too young to have a relationship with money beyond allowance and maybe a savings account. The economic worldview that will shape your adult decisions is being built right now, in ways you don't consciously recognize.</p><p>You're growing up in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and the pandemic recession. Your parents might have financial anxiety that you've absorbed. The message—spoken or unspoken—is that the economy is fragile, that security is an illusion, that the future is uncertain.</p><p>Housing will likely be even more unaffordable by the time you're ready to buy. Wages will likely have continued stagnating. The wealth gap will likely have widened. The challenges Millennials faced will be your challenges, only worse. That's the trajectory, unless something changes.</p><p>Student debt will still exist, probably. College costs will be higher. The return on education investment will be more uncertain. You'll have to calculate whether degrees are worth it in ways previous generations didn't.</p><p>But you'll also have tools and information they didn't have. You're growing up with financial literacy content on TikTok. You'll have AI to help you make decisions. Whether that compensates for the structural challenges, no one knows. You're the experiment.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You'll be launching into adulthood in the 2030s. AI will be mature. Climate change will be undeniable. The world will look different than anyone predicts. You'll be figuring out careers, relationships, identities in a landscape that's still forming. It'll be chaotic. It might also be exciting.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> This is when previous generations settled down—careers, families, mortgages. Whether those concepts will still exist in the 2040s is an open question. You might have kids in a world that's much hotter. You might have careers that don't resemble anything we'd call a job today. You might build a life that looks nothing like your parents' lives.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Mid-century. Climate change will have reshaped where people can live. Technology will have reshaped what work means. You'll be in your prime, navigating a world that your grandparents wouldn't recognize. The skills that got you here might not be the skills you need going forward.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> You'll be thinking about retirement—if retirement still exists as a concept. Longevity science might have extended lifespans. AI might have collapsed traditional economies. The future is too uncertain to predict, which is both terrifying and liberating.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_PLUS}}+):</strong> You'll be elder statespeople of a world that doesn't exist yet. The choices made during your childhood and adolescence—by you, by your generation, by humanity—will have compounded. You'll know whether we solved climate change or didn't. You'll know whether AI liberated or enslaved us. You'll know things we can only guess at now. Good luck. We're sorry for the mess.</p>"
