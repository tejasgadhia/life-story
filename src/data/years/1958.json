The weight of a View-Master pressed against a face, clicking through Grand Canyon slides in the living room. The particular crackle of a brand-new Hula Hoop\u2014100 million of them sold the year they were born, plastic circles spinning around every kid in the neighborhood. The earliest years had textures that no digital device can replicate.</p><p>At one, Barbie debuted\u2014eleven and a half inches of adult-bodied doll that scandalized some mothers and delighted their daughters. By three, children were watching Bozo the Clown and Captain Kangaroo, learning that television was the new babysitter. The Flintstones premiered when they were two\u2014a cartoon for adults that kids claimed as their own. They knew Yabba-Dabba-Doo before they knew their multiplication tables.</p><p>School supplies were simple and specific. Big Chief writing tablets with that red cover. The fat pencils for little hands. Crayola boxes with the built-in sharpener\u2014the 64-count if they were lucky, with colors like Burnt Sienna and Periwinkle that made them feel sophisticated. The smell of mimeograph sheets, purple ink still wet, handed out warm from the machine.</p><p>At five, the world cracked. They might not remember the specific day, but they remember the aftermath\u2014adults crying in ways they'd never seen, the television left on for days, the feeling that something enormous had broken. Dallas changed everything, even if they couldn't name what changed. At six, the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan, and suddenly music wasn't just what parents listened to\u2014it was theirs. By eleven, they watched men walk on the moon, and the future seemed inevitable.</p><p>TV dinners came on folding trays, Swanson's aluminum compartments keeping the mashed potatoes away from the Salisbury steak. Tang sat in the cabinet\u2014the drink the astronauts did. Sugar Pops and Frosted Flakes because Tony the Tiger told them they were Gr-r-reat! Saturday mornings meant cartoons until parents made them go outside\u2014Looney Tunes, The Jetsons, Jonny Quest if they were allowed to watch the violent one.</p><p>Vietnam crept into childhood slowly, then all at once. By ten, older brothers and neighborhood kids were shipping out. The draft hung over every boy like a distant storm\u2014not yet their problem, but visibly approaching. Body counts scrolled across the nightly news while families ate dinner. Walter Cronkite became the most trusted man in America because someone had to explain what was happening, even when it made no sense.</p>"

This generation is one of roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans born between 1946 and 1964, the largest generation in American history until Millennials eventually caught up. They were the pig in the python, reshaping every institution they passed through by sheer numbers.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At five, President Kennedy was shot in Dallas. November 22, 1963.</span> They were in kindergarten. The teacher's face when the news came. Adults weeping openly. The funeral on television for days\u2014the riderless horse, little John-John's salute. This is this generation's defining rupture, the moment that split the American century in two. The optimism of Camelot died in that motorcade, and something in their childhood died with it.</p><p>The defining split in this generation happened over Vietnam. Some would protest the war, march on Washington, burn draft cards. Others would serve honorably and resent the protesters forever. Some would do both. The culture war that started in the 1960s never really ended\u2014they're still fighting it, sixty years later, still arguing about the same basic questions of patriotism and dissent.</p><p>This generation didn't just live through the Civil Rights movement\u2014they were shaped by it. They were seven when the Civil Rights Act passed, ten when King was assassinated. Whether their family marched or resisted, the transformation was inescapable. The America they grew up in was legally segregated. The America they inherited wasn't. That didn't happen by accident.</p><p>Boomers stayed in power longer than any generation before. They're the CEOs who won't retire, the politicians clinging to office into their eighties, the homeowners sitting on properties worth multiples of what they paid. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Their critics call it generational hoarding. They call it earned success. The truth, as usual, is somewhere in between.</span></p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

Adults called it a fad. They were right. But what a fad. The first year on earth was soundtracked by spinning plastic and the last great year of original rock and roll.</p><p>Musically, 1958 was the year everything almost ended. Elvis Presley got drafted into the Army. Little Richard left rock for the ministry. Jerry Lee Lewis married his thirteen-year-old cousin and destroyed his career overnight. Chuck Berry faced legal troubles that would sideline him for years. Buddy Holly had exactly one more year to live. The music that defined rebellion was suddenly leaderless.</p><p>At six, the British Invasion landed. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan, February 1964\u201473 million Americans watching, which meant basically everyone with a television. Children wanted a guitar. They wanted the haircut. The Rolling Stones followed, then The Who, then The Kinks, then everyone else. By thirteen, Woodstock happened, and rock became a generational identity marker, not just entertainment.</p><p>Television raised this generation. The Rifleman premiered when they were born\u2014Chuck Connors with that modified Winchester, frontier justice every week. 77 Sunset Strip made private detectives glamorous. At two, The Twilight Zone started teaching them that reality was negotiable. At five, The Beverly Hillbillies proved Americans would watch anything. They grew up on Bonanza, Gunsmoke, The Andy Griffith Show\u2014westerns and small-town wisdom and laugh tracks.</p><p>Movies meant drive-ins and Saturday matinees. At ten, 2001: A Space Odyssey left parents baffled and children mesmerized. Eleven when Easy Rider made them want a motorcycle they weren't old enough to ride. Fourteen when The Godfather proved movies could be literature. Seventeen when Jaws invented the summer blockbuster and kept everyone out of the water. Hollywood grew up with this generation\u2014got darker, more complex, more willing to challenge the audience.</p><p>Their teenage years had a soundtrack: The Doors, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix\u2014all dead by the time they were fifteen. Then disco arrived, and everything their generation had built musically seemed to crumble into sequins and four-on-the-floor beats. Some converted. Some resisted. The Saturday Night Fever era remains contested territory.</p>"

By July, it did. this generation arrived at the exact moment the space race kicked into high gear, and the future suddenly seemed like it might actually happen on schedule.</p><p>Childhood was the age of the atom\u2014nuclear power plants promising electricity too cheap to meter, backyard fallout shelters, those yellow-and-black radiation symbols everywhere. Technology meant progress and terror in equal measure. The same science that put men on the moon could end civilization in thirty minutes.</p><p>At eleven, they watched Neil Armstrong step onto the lunar surface. Grainy black-and-white footage, that ghostly voice from 238,000 miles away, families gathered around a television that probably still had rabbit ears. They genuinely believed they'd vacation on Mars by the time they retired. That hasn't happened, but the optimism was intoxicating while it lasted.</p><p>The transistor radio changed their adolescence. Suddenly music was portable, personal\u2014they could listen to what they wanted without negotiating with parents over the living room console. They carried Top 40 in their pocket, tuned to KHJ or WABC or whatever local station played the hits. Parents didn't understand why they needed music everywhere. They didn't understand why their parents didn't.</p><p>This generation adapted to computers in middle age, which was both harder and easier than people assume. They learned typing on actual typewriters\u2014the IBM Selectric was a revelation, that bouncing ball element replacing jammed keys. Word processors followed. Then personal computers. Then email. Then the internet. Then smartphones. They've made more technological transitions than any generation in history, and they're still not done.</p><p>The Boeing 707 entered commercial service the year they were born, making air travel routine rather than luxury. They'd grow up to be the first frequent flyer generation\u2014shrinking the world in ways their parents, who might never have left their home state, couldn't imagine. When they were born, crossing an ocean meant a ship. When they were twenty, it meant a few hours.</p>"

Here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape their entire understanding of American power. The country they'd been born into seemed different afterward.</p><p>At six, the Beatles arrived, and the culture shifted overnight. At seven, the Civil Rights Act passed after Bull Connor's fire hoses and the March on Washington made segregation impossible to defend. At ten, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated within two months of each other. Their childhood was bookended by bullets.</p><p>Vietnam was the defining trauma. At eleven, the Tet Offensive proved the government had been lying about how the war was going. Seventeen when Saigon fell and helicopters evacuated the embassy. The draft lottery started when they were thirteen\u2014suddenly fate was tied to ping-pong balls and birth dates. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. They turned eighteen in 1976, just late enough to miss combat, just early enough to have spent their entire adolescence knowing it might happen.</p><p>At sixteen, they watched Watergate unfold. The hearings were summer television\u2014John Dean, Alexander Butterfield, the tapes. Nixon's 'I am not a crook' became an instant ironic catchphrase. At sixteen, they watched a president resign in disgrace. The institution of the presidency never looked quite the same again.</p><p>At twenty-three, Reagan was elected, launching the conservative revolution. At twenty-nine, the Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after launch\u2014they probably watched it live, like 17% of Americans did. At thirty-one, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Cold War that had defined their entire conscious life simply ended. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, they watched the towers fall on September 11th.</span> At fifty, the financial system collapsed.

Stagflation\u2014that impossible combination of high inflation and economic stagnation that wasn't supposed to exist. Interest rates hit 20% in 1980. Gas lines stretched around blocks. The stable industrial economy their parents had known was visibly crumbling. If they went to college, they could still pay tuition with summer jobs\u2014but the factory jobs that had built the middle class were disappearing fast.</p><p>Then Reaganomics happened, and the rules changed in their favor. If they bought a house before prices exploded, they rode the greatest wealth-building wave in American history. If they invested in the stock market during the long bull run from 1982 to 2000, their portfolio multiplied. If they stayed employed at companies that still offered pensions, they got the last of them. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The door closed behind them.</span></p><p>Career paths looked like this: graduate, get hired, stay loyal, climb the ladder, retire with a pension. The model still worked\u2014barely\u2014when they started. By the time they hit middle management, it was being dismantled. Layoffs, downsizing, restructuring\u2014the euphemisms piled up. The social contract between employers and employees shredded while they were still working under its assumptions.</p><p>This generation adapted through technological revolutions that would have been science fiction when they started. Typewriters to word processors to personal computers to smartphones. Memos to faxes to email to Slack. They learned every new system because they had to. Younger workers don't understand that nobody trained them\u2014they taught themselves, often after hours, because falling behind meant falling out.</p><p>If they're still working, people wonder why they haven't retired. If they've retired, they're probably working part-time anyway\u2014because pensions aren't what they were, because Social Security doesn't stretch as far as promised, because they're healthy enough to contribute and anxious enough about outliving their savings to keep showing up. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The retirement their parents had isn't the retirement they're getting.</span></p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit\u2014and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> The market recovered eventually.

When they wrote letters that took days to arrive, each word chosen carefully because stamps cost money and they couldn't unsend them. When 'going steady' meant wearing someone's ring on a chain around their neck, a public declaration visible to everyone in the hallway.</p><p>They grew up with the formal courtship rules their parents tried to enforce\u2014chaperones, curfews, separate beds at all costs. Then the sexual revolution happened, and by the time they were in college, the rules had been rewritten or thrown out entirely. They navigated the transition between eras, never quite belonging to either one.</p><p>They probably married younger than their children did. Average age for first marriage in this generation: early to mid-twenties. By the time Millennials hit that age, they were still figuring out career paths. Boomers had mortgages and children before Millennials had stable jobs. Whether that's wisdom or premature commitment depends on how the marriages turned out.</p><p>Divorce rates peaked during their prime marrying years. The stigma that kept their parents trapped in unhappy marriages didn't hold the same weight for them. They were free to leave\u2014and many did. Half of first marriages ended. Blended families became normal. The nuclear family their childhood idealized turned out to be optional.</p><p>Long-distance communication meant phone calls that cost real money. They budgeted for them. Kept them short. Said what mattered because every minute was expensive. Letters took days\u2014they wrote them anyway, developing a patience for asynchronous communication that their grandchildren can't imagine. When they wanted to reach someone, they had to work for it.</p><p>This generation watches their children and grandchildren navigate dating apps, relationship dynamics conducted entirely through text, breakups via message. They've adapted\u2014they text, they video chat, they have opinions about emoji usage. But they remember when presence was physical, when commitment was demonstrated through showing up, when love letters were actual letters.

And then, just as they were finding their footing, everything got better for forty years straight.</p><p>When they started working, median home prices were three times median income. They bought when buying was possible.

They learned to save because inflation could eat their paycheck. Then they learned to invest because markets only went up (until they didn't). They rode the longest bull market in American history from 1982 to 2000, watched the dot-com bust take some of it back, watched 2008 threaten everything they'd built.</p><p>This generation has lived through enough economic crises to know stability is an illusion: the 1970s recession, 1987's Black Monday, the dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis, COVID. Each time, experts said nobody could have predicted it. Each time, the pain fell hardest on people with the least margin for error. They learned to keep reserves, pay down debt, never trust that good times will last.</p><p>Retirement planning became their generation's obsession. Their parents got pensions and Social Security and never worried about outliving their money. They got 401(k)s\u2014all the risk transferred to them, all the responsibility for investing correctly, all the anxiety about whether their spreadsheets were right. <span class=\"hero-callout\">They've spent decades trying to save enough, never quite sure what 'enough' means when they might live thirty years past their last paycheck.</span></p><p>Credit cards arrived when they were in their twenties.

They worked hard and succeeded, therefore hard work leads to success. But the economy they entered isn't the economy that exists now. The college they paid for with summer jobs now costs a year's salary. They're not wrong that they worked hard. They're wrong that working hard was sufficient.</p><p>This cohort grew up when institutions functioned\u2014imperfectly, but recognizably. Government delivered mail and built highways. Corporations provided careers and pensions. Churches and schools and civic organizations formed the fabric of community life. They trust institutions because they experienced them working. Younger generations have only seen them fail, and their faith looks like naivety to them.</p><p>The bootstraps narrative blinds them to structural advantages. The GI Bill that educated their parents. The FHA loans that built suburban wealth (while explicitly excluding Black families). The union jobs that paid enough to support families on single incomes. These weren't natural features of capitalism\u2014they were policy choices that benefited them and then were dismantled before their children could access them.</p><p>This generation stayed in power longer than any before it. Boomers run companies, dominate Congress, sit on corporate boards\u2014and won't leave. Some of this is genuine capability. Some of it is refusal to pass the torch. The generational handoff that happened naturally before them has stalled. Whether that's because they're uniquely valuable or uniquely stubborn depends on who's asking.</p><p>This cohort sometimes conflates discomfort with discipline. They endured toxic workplaces, sacrificed personal time, missed kids' events\u2014and they're proud of surviving it. But survival shouldn't be confused with optimal outcomes. Younger workers who demand better conditions aren't weak\u2014they're unwilling to accept unnecessary suffering. This generation normalized things that should have been questioned.</p><p>Technology fatigue is real, and they've earned it. They've adapted to more technological change than any generation in history\u2014from typewriters to smartphones in one career. But the exhaustion sometimes manifests as resistance to further learning, dismissing new tools as unnecessary because they managed without them. They managed without GPS too. That doesn't mean maps were superior.</p>"

The optimism of their 1960s childhood had curdled into 1970s malaise. They took whatever job they could get, married earlier than their children would, started families before they felt ready. Reagan was elected when they were twenty-three, launching the conservative revolution that would reshape everything. This decade was supposed to be about possibility. It was about survival.</p><p><strong>30s (1988-1998):</strong> The economy improved, and if they'd positioned themselves correctly, they caught the updraft. Property appreciated. Portfolios grew. They hit their professional stride, raised children, and believed the American Dream was still intact\u2014harder than their parents made it look, but achievable. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War ended. The internet emerged. Everything seemed possible again.</p><p><strong>40s (1998-2008):</strong> Peak earning decade. Kids in school or heading to college. Career authority established. They started thinking about retirement as something concrete rather than theoretical. The dot-com bust hurt, but recovery came quickly. Then 2008 demolished retirement plans, crashed portfolios, collapsed housing values. They were fifty when everything they'd built felt precarious.</p><p><strong>50s (2008-2018):</strong> The financial crisis reshaped their timeline. Recovery took years. Some lost jobs they'd thought were secure and never fully recovered professionally. By the time the economy stabilized, they were closer to retirement than they wanted to be with less saved than they needed. They worked longer than they'd planned because they had to. The goalposts moved while they were running.</p><p><strong>60s (2018-2028):</strong> Retirement became real\u2014or didn't, because the math didn't work. They're navigating Medicare, Social Security optimization, the question of whether their savings will outlast them. Their parents lived into their eighties. They might live into their nineties. Nobody planned for three decades of retirement. COVID hit when they were sixty-two, reshaping everything again.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2028+):</strong> Seventy doesn't look like it used to. They're healthier, more active, more engaged than their grandparents were at this age. But they're also more financially anxious, more politically polarized, more bewildered by a world they don't recognize. They've witnessed more change than any generation in history\u2014from segregation to a Black president, from typewriters to AI, from letters to instant messages.

They watched Boomers dominate every institution and wondered when their turn would come. It hasn't, really.
