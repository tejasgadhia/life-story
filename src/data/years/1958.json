      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1958-1970</h2><p>The smell of Silly Putty, fresh from the egg. The weight of a View-Master pressed against your face, clicking through Grand Canyon slides in the living room. The particular crackle of a brand-new Hula Hoop—100 million of them sold the year you were born, plastic circles spinning around every kid in the neighborhood. Your earliest years had textures that no digital device can replicate.</p><p>At one, Barbie debuted—eleven and a half inches of adult-bodied doll that scandalized some mothers and delighted their daughters. By three, you were watching Bozo the Clown and Captain Kangaroo, learning that television was the new babysitter. The Flintstones premiered when you were two—a cartoon for adults that kids claimed as their own. You knew Yabba-Dabba-Doo before you knew your multiplication tables.</p><p>Your school supplies were simple and specific. Big Chief writing tablets with that red cover. The fat pencils for little hands. Crayola boxes with the built-in sharpener—the 64-count if you were lucky, with colors like Burnt Sienna and Periwinkle that made you feel sophisticated. The smell of mimeograph sheets, purple ink still wet, handed out warm from the machine.</p><p>At five, the world cracked. You might not remember the specific day, but you remember the aftermath—adults crying in ways you'd never seen, the television left on for days, the feeling that something enormous had broken. Dallas changed everything, even if you couldn't name what changed. At six, the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan, and suddenly music wasn't just what your parents listened to—it was yours. By eleven, you watched men walk on the moon, and the future seemed inevitable.</p><p>You ate TV dinners on folding trays, Swanson's aluminum compartments keeping the mashed potatoes away from the Salisbury steak. You drank Tang because the astronauts did. You begged for Sugar Pops and Frosted Flakes because Tony the Tiger told you they were Gr-r-reat! Saturday mornings meant cartoons until your parents made you go outside—Looney Tunes, The Jetsons, Jonny Quest if you were allowed to watch the violent one.</p><p>Vietnam crept into your childhood slowly, then all at once. By ten, older brothers and neighborhood kids were shipping out. The draft hung over every boy like a distant storm—not yet your problem, but visibly approaching. Body counts scrolled across the nightly news while your family ate dinner. Walter Cronkite became the most trusted man in America because someone had to explain what was happening, even when it made no sense.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The name came from demographics—soldiers returned from World War II, the economy boomed, and birth rates spiked for nearly two decades. You're one of roughly 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964, the largest generation in American history until Millennials eventually caught up. You were the pig in the python, reshaping every institution you passed through by sheer numbers.</p><p>At five, President Kennedy was shot in Dallas. November 22, 1963. You were in kindergarten. The teacher's face when the news came. Adults weeping openly. The funeral on television for days—the riderless horse, little John-John's salute. This is your generation's defining rupture, the moment that split the American century in two. The optimism of Camelot died in that motorcade, and something in your childhood died with it.</p><p>The defining split in your generation happened over Vietnam. Some of you would protest the war, march on Washington, burn draft cards. Others would serve honorably and resent the protesters forever. Some would do both. The culture war that started in the 1960s never really ended—you're still fighting it, sixty years later, still arguing about the same basic questions of patriotism and dissent.</p><p>Your generation didn't just live through the Civil Rights movement—you were shaped by it. You were seven when the Civil Rights Act passed, ten when King was assassinated. Whether your family marched or resisted, the transformation was inescapable. The America you grew up in was legally segregated. The America you inherited wasn't. That didn't happen by accident.</p><p>Boomers stayed in power longer than any generation before. You're the CEOs who won't retire, the politicians clinging to office into their eighties, the homeowners sitting on properties worth multiples of what you paid. Your critics call it generational hoarding. You call it earned success. The truth, as usual, is somewhere in between.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The Hula Hoop craze was peaking the year you were born—Wham-O sold 25 million in four months, and by summer's end, 100 million plastic circles were spinning around American waists. Adults called it a fad. They were right. But what a fad. Your first year on earth was soundtracked by spinning plastic and the last great year of original rock and roll.</p><p>Musically, 1958 was the year everything almost ended. Elvis Presley got drafted into the Army. Little Richard left rock for the ministry. Jerry Lee Lewis married his thirteen-year-old cousin and destroyed his career overnight. Chuck Berry faced legal troubles that would sideline him for years. Buddy Holly had exactly one more year to live. The music that defined rebellion was suddenly leaderless.</p><p>At six, the British Invasion landed. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan, February 1964—73 million Americans watching, which meant basically everyone with a television. You wanted a guitar. You wanted the haircut. The Rolling Stones followed, then The Who, then The Kinks, then everyone else. By thirteen, Woodstock happened, and rock became a generational identity marker, not just entertainment.</p><p>Television raised you. The Rifleman premiered when you were born—Chuck Connors with that modified Winchester, frontier justice every week. 77 Sunset Strip made private detectives glamorous. At two, The Twilight Zone started teaching you that reality was negotiable. At five, The Beverly Hillbillies proved Americans would watch anything. You grew up on Bonanza, Gunsmoke, The Andy Griffith Show—westerns and small-town wisdom and laugh tracks.</p><p>Movies meant drive-ins and Saturday matinees. You were ten when 2001: A Space Odyssey left your parents baffled and you mesmerized. Eleven when Easy Rider made you want a motorcycle you weren't old enough to ride. Fourteen when The Godfather proved movies could be literature. Seventeen when Jaws invented the summer blockbuster and kept everyone out of the water. Hollywood grew up with you—got darker, more complex, more willing to challenge the audience.</p><p>Your teenage years had a soundtrack: The Doors, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix—all dead by the time you were fifteen. Then disco arrived, and everything your generation had built musically seemed to crumble into sequins and four-on-the-floor beats. Some of you converted. Some of you resisted. The Saturday Night Fever era remains contested territory.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>Explorer 1 launched the year you were born—America's first satellite, a desperate response to Sputnik's humiliation. NASA didn't exist in January 1958. By July, it did. You arrived at the exact moment the space race kicked into high gear, and the future suddenly seemed like it might actually happen on schedule.</p><p>Your childhood was the age of the atom—nuclear power plants promising electricity too cheap to meter, backyard fallout shelters, those yellow-and-black radiation symbols everywhere. Technology meant progress and terror in equal measure. The same science that put men on the moon could end civilization in thirty minutes.</p><p>At eleven, you watched Neil Armstrong step onto the lunar surface. Grainy black-and-white footage, that ghostly voice from 238,000 miles away, your family gathered around a television that probably still had rabbit ears. You genuinely believed you'd vacation on Mars by the time you retired. That hasn't happened, but the optimism was intoxicating while it lasted.</p><p>The transistor radio changed your adolescence. Suddenly music was portable, personal—you could listen to what you wanted without negotiating with parents over the living room console. You carried Top 40 in your pocket, tuned to KHJ or WABC or whatever local station played the hits. Your parents didn't understand why you needed music everywhere. You didn't understand why they didn't.</p><p>You adapted to computers in middle age, which was both harder and easier than people assume. You learned typing on actual typewriters—the IBM Selectric was a revelation, that bouncing ball element replacing jammed keys. Word processors followed. Then personal computers. Then email. Then the internet. Then smartphones. You've made more technological transitions than any generation in history, and you're still not done.</p><p>The Boeing 707 entered commercial service the year you were born, making air travel routine rather than luxury. You'd grow up to be the first frequent flyer generation—shrinking the world in ways your parents, who might never have left their home state, couldn't imagine. When you were born, crossing an ocean meant a ship. When you were twenty, it meant a few hours.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>At five, Dallas. The rupture that defines your generation happened while you were in kindergarten—the details live in your Generational Identity. Here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape your entire understanding of American power. The country you'd been born into seemed different afterward.</p><p>At six, the Beatles arrived, and the culture shifted overnight. At seven, the Civil Rights Act passed after Bull Connor's fire hoses and the March on Washington made segregation impossible to defend. At ten, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated within two months of each other. Your childhood was bookended by bullets.</p><p>Vietnam was the defining trauma. You were eleven when the Tet Offensive proved the government had been lying about how the war was going. Seventeen when Saigon fell and helicopters evacuated the embassy. The draft lottery started when you were thirteen—suddenly your fate was tied to ping-pong balls and birth dates. You turned eighteen in 1976, just late enough to miss combat, just early enough to have spent your entire adolescence knowing it might happen.</p><p>At sixteen, you watched Watergate unfold. The hearings were summer television—John Dean, Alexander Butterfield, the tapes. Nixon's 'I am not a crook' became an instant ironic catchphrase. At sixteen, you watched a president resign in disgrace. The institution of the presidency never looked quite the same again.</p><p>At twenty-three, Reagan was elected, launching the conservative revolution. At twenty-nine, the Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after launch—you probably watched it live, like 17% of Americans did. At thirty-one, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Cold War that had defined your entire conscious life simply ended. At forty-three, you watched the towers fall on September 11th. At fifty, the financial system collapsed. History didn't wait for you to catch your breath between crises.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Here's what nobody told you: you'd enter the workforce at exactly the wrong moment, and then the economy would work in your favor for the next forty years.</p><p>You graduated into stagflation—that impossible combination of high inflation and economic stagnation that wasn't supposed to exist. Interest rates hit 20% in 1980. Gas lines stretched around blocks. The stable industrial economy your parents had known was visibly crumbling. If you went to college, you could still pay tuition with summer jobs—but the factory jobs that had built the middle class were disappearing fast.</p><p>Then Reaganomics happened, and the rules changed in your favor. If you bought a house before prices exploded, you rode the greatest wealth-building wave in American history. If you invested in the stock market during the long bull run from 1982 to 2000, your portfolio multiplied. If you stayed employed at companies that still offered pensions, you got the last of them. The door closed behind you.</p><p>Your career path looked like this: graduate, get hired, stay loyal, climb the ladder, retire with a pension. The model still worked—barely—when you started. By the time you hit middle management, it was being dismantled. Layoffs, downsizing, restructuring—the euphemisms piled up. The social contract between employers and employees shredded while you were still working under its assumptions.</p><p>You adapted through technological revolutions that would have been science fiction when you started. Typewriters to word processors to personal computers to smartphones. Memos to faxes to email to Slack. You learned every new system because you had to. Younger workers don't understand that nobody trained you—you taught yourselves, often after hours, because falling behind meant falling out.</p><p>If you're still working, people wonder why you haven't retired. If you've retired, you're probably working part-time anyway—because pensions aren't what they were, because Social Security doesn't stretch as far as promised, because you're healthy enough to contribute and anxious enough about outliving your savings to keep showing up. The retirement your parents had isn't the retirement you're getting.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when getting someone's phone number was a victory—and calling meant potentially talking to their father first? When you wrote letters that took days to arrive, each word chosen carefully because stamps cost money and you couldn't unsend them? When 'going steady' meant wearing someone's ring on a chain around your neck, a public declaration visible to everyone in the hallway?</p><p>You grew up with the formal courtship rules your parents tried to enforce—chaperones, curfews, separate beds at all costs. Then the sexual revolution happened, and by the time you were in college, the rules had been rewritten or thrown out entirely. You navigated the transition between eras, never quite belonging to either one.</p><p>You probably married younger than your children did. Average age for first marriage in your generation: early to mid-twenties. By the time Millennials hit that age, they were still figuring out career paths. You had mortgages and children before they had stable jobs. Whether that's wisdom or premature commitment depends on how the marriages turned out.</p><p>Divorce rates peaked during your prime marrying years. The stigma that kept your parents trapped in unhappy marriages didn't hold the same weight for you. You were free to leave—and many of you did. Half of first marriages ended. Blended families became normal. The nuclear family your childhood idealized turned out to be optional.</p><p>Long-distance communication meant phone calls that cost real money. You budgeted for them. Kept them short. Said what mattered because every minute was expensive. Letters took days—you wrote them anyway, developing a patience for asynchronous communication that your grandchildren can't imagine. When you wanted to reach someone, you had to work for it.</p><p>You've watched your children and grandchildren navigate dating apps, relationship dynamics conducted entirely through text, breakups via message. You've adapted—you text, you video chat, you have opinions about emoji usage. But you remember when presence was physical, when commitment was demonstrated through showing up, when love letters were actual letters. You're not sure the new way is better, even if you've learned to use it.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You entered adulthood during the worst economy since the Depression—stagflation, oil shocks, interest rates that made mortgages punishing. The American Dream your parents lived seemed broken. And then, just as you were finding your footing, everything got better for forty years straight.</p><p>When you started working, median home prices were three times median income. You bought when buying was possible. Your generation accumulated houses for $50,000 that are worth $500,000 now. You didn't do anything clever—you just showed up when showing up was enough.</p><p>Your financial psychology was shaped by the 1970s scarcity followed by 1980s abundance. You learned to save because inflation could eat your paycheck. Then you learned to invest because markets only went up (until they didn't). You rode the longest bull market in American history from 1982 to 2000, watched the dot-com bust take some of it back, watched 2008 threaten everything you'd built.</p><p>You've lived through enough economic crises to know stability is an illusion: the 1970s recession, 1987's Black Monday, the dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis, COVID. Each time, experts said nobody could have predicted it. Each time, the pain fell hardest on people with the least margin for error. You learned to keep reserves, pay down debt, never trust that good times will last.</p><p>Retirement planning became your generation's obsession. Your parents got pensions and Social Security and never worried about outliving their money. You got 401(k)s—all the risk transferred to you, all the responsibility for investing correctly, all the anxiety about whether your spreadsheets were right. You've spent decades trying to save enough, never quite sure what 'enough' means when you might live thirty years past your last paycheck.</p><p>Credit cards arrived when you were in your twenties. The idea of buying now and paying later was novel. Your parents would have been horrified. You adapted, using credit strategically while their voices echoed in your head about living within your means.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your biggest blind spot is the assumption that your experience is replicable. You worked hard and succeeded, therefore hard work leads to success. But the economy you entered isn't the economy that exists now. The college you paid for with summer jobs now costs a year's salary. You're not wrong that you worked hard. You're wrong that working hard was sufficient.</p><p>You grew up when institutions functioned—imperfectly, but recognizably. Government delivered mail and built highways. Corporations provided careers and pensions. Churches and schools and civic organizations formed the fabric of community life. You trust institutions because you experienced them working. Younger generations have only seen them fail, and your faith looks like naivety to them.</p><p>The bootstraps narrative blinds you to structural advantages. The GI Bill that educated your parents. The FHA loans that built suburban wealth (while explicitly excluding Black families). The union jobs that paid enough to support families on single incomes. These weren't natural features of capitalism—they were policy choices that benefited you and then were dismantled before your children could access them.</p><p>Your generation stayed in power longer than any before it. Boomers run companies, dominate Congress, sit on corporate boards—and won't leave. Some of this is genuine capability. Some of it is refusal to pass the torch. The generational handoff that happened naturally before you has stalled. Whether that's because you're uniquely valuable or uniquely stubborn depends on who's asking.</p><p>You sometimes conflate discomfort with discipline. You endured toxic workplaces, sacrificed personal time, missed kids' events—and you're proud of surviving it. But survival shouldn't be confused with optimal outcomes. Younger workers who demand better conditions aren't weak—they're unwilling to accept unnecessary suffering. Your generation normalized things that should have been questioned.</p><p>Technology fatigue is real, and you've earned it. You've adapted to more technological change than any generation in history—from typewriters to smartphones in one career. But the exhaustion sometimes manifests as resistance to further learning, dismissing new tools as unnecessary because you managed without them. You managed without GPS too. That doesn't mean maps were superior.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1978-1988):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation, gas lines, and the Iran hostage crisis. The optimism of your 1960s childhood had curdled into 1970s malaise. You took whatever job you could get, married earlier than your children would, started families before you felt ready. Reagan was elected when you were twenty-three, launching the conservative revolution that would reshape everything. This decade was supposed to be about possibility. It was about survival.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1988-1998):</strong> The economy improved, and if you'd positioned yourself correctly, you caught the updraft. Property appreciated. Portfolios grew. You hit your professional stride, raised children, and believed the American Dream was still intact—harder than your parents made it look, but achievable. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War ended. The internet emerged. Everything seemed possible again.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1998-2008):</strong> Peak earning decade. Kids in school or heading to college. Career authority established. You started thinking about retirement as something concrete rather than theoretical. The dot-com bust hurt, but recovery came quickly. Then 2008 demolished retirement plans, crashed portfolios, collapsed housing values. You were fifty when everything you'd built felt precarious.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2008-2018):</strong> The financial crisis reshaped your timeline. Recovery took years. Some of you lost jobs you'd thought were secure and never fully recovered professionally. By the time the economy stabilized, you were closer to retirement than you wanted to be with less saved than you needed. You worked longer than you'd planned because you had to. The goalposts moved while you were running.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2018-2028):</strong> Retirement became real—or didn't, because the math didn't work. You're navigating Medicare, Social Security optimization, the question of whether your savings will outlast you. Your parents lived into their eighties. You might live into your nineties. Nobody planned for three decades of retirement. COVID hit when you were sixty-two, reshaping everything again.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2028+):</strong> Seventy doesn't look like it used to. You're healthier, more active, more engaged than your grandparents were at this age. But you're also more financially anxious, more politically polarized, more bewildered by a world you don't recognize. You've witnessed more change than any generation in history—from segregation to a Black president, from typewriters to AI, from letters to instant messages. The world your grandchildren inherit will be unrecognizable to them too. That's the only constant.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>4.2 million Americans were born the same year as you—part of the demographic wave that became the largest generation in American history. You've maintained dominance in political power even as Millennials overtook you in raw numbers. The pig in the python, still moving through institutions, reshaping everything you touch.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They lived through the Depression and World War II as children. They trusted institutions you learned to question. They accepted the organization man ethos you would eventually reject. They retired with pensions you watched disappear. They kept their heads down; you raised yours. Whether that's courage or narcissism depends on who's telling the story.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They're the forgotten middle child—too young for Woodstock, too old for the internet age. They watched you dominate every institution and wondered when their turn would come. It hasn't, really. They're the latchkey generation, raised on TV dinners and divorce, and they're cynical in ways you never quite managed. They'll probably skip straight from your shadow to Millennial ascendance.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> The wealth gap is stark. Your generation controlled 21% of national wealth at their age. They control 7%. You bought houses when they cost three years' salary. They face eight to ten times median income. You got pensions. They got 401(k)s and student debt. The economy worked for you in ways it doesn't work for them, and their frustration is mathematical, not moral.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You're from different planets. You remember when technology was optional—they were born with it in their hands. You trusted institutions they've only seen fail. You believe systems can be reformed from within. They're building alternatives because they don't believe reform is possible. You have nostalgia. They have TikTok.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've exceeded that—modern medicine, lifestyle awareness, pure luck. Boomers are living into their eighties and nineties, spending more years in retirement than anyone anticipated. This creates complications: healthcare costs, longevity planning, the strange experience of outliving the life you planned. You're healthier than your parents were at this age. You're also more anxious about what happens next.</p>"
