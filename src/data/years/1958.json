      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1958-1970</h2><p>You were born the year NASA opened its doors and America decided losing the space race wasn't an option. Sputnik had launched the previous October, and the entire country had its eyes on the sky, half in wonder, half in fear. Eisenhower was president, the economy was humming, and suburban sprawl was remaking the American landscape one split-level ranch house at a time.</p><p>Your childhood was peak Americana. Station wagons with wood paneling. Backyard barbecues. Fallout shelters in the basement, because nuclear annihilation was always one bad decision away. You learned to duck and cover in school—an absurd response to atomic bombs, but it gave everyone something to do with their anxiety.</p><p>You were five when JFK was shot in Dallas. You probably don't remember where you were, but you remember the adults crying. You were seven when the Civil Rights Act passed. Ten when Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were killed within two months of each other. Your childhood ended with two assassinations and a war on TV every night during dinner.</p><p>Vietnam was the background noise of your adolescence. The draft hung over every teenage boy like a countdown clock. You watched older brothers, cousins, and neighborhood kids ship out. Some came back different. Some didn't come back at all. The war was in the living room every evening—body counts read like sports scores on the nightly news.</p><p>Technology-wise, you were the TV generation. Most families had one set, black and white until color became affordable. You watched the moon landing live. You got your news from Walter Cronkite, your cartoons on Saturday mornings, and your parents told you the television would rot your brain. They were probably right, but it didn't stop anyone.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the post-World War II birth surge—soldiers came home, the economy boomed, and everyone started making babies. Your generation is roughly 76 million people in the US, the largest generation in American history until Millennials eventually nudged ahead.</p><p>The defining experiences for Boomers were Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, and Watergate. You watched the government lie about a war, fight against basic human rights, and then get caught covering up crimes. The institutions your parents trusted, you learned to question. The American Dream came with fine print nobody had mentioned.</p><p>Your generation split into two camps that never fully reconciled: those who protested the war and those who fought it. Those who marched for civil rights and those who resisted integration. Those who grew their hair long and those who kept it short. The culture war started with you and never really ended.</p><p>Boomers built the modern economy and then stayed in charge longer than any generation before. You're the CEOs who won't retire, the politicians who refuse to pass the torch, the homeowners sitting on properties worth ten times what you paid. Whether that's earned success or generational hoarding depends on who's telling the story.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year the hula hoop became a national obsession—100 million sold in four months. Adults called it a fad. They were right, but for one summer, every kid in America was spinning plastic around their waist like their lives depended on it.</p><p>Musically, 1958 was the year rock and roll went mainstream and then nearly died. Elvis got drafted. Little Richard found religion. Chuck Berry got arrested. Jerry Lee Lewis married his 13-year-old cousin and destroyed his career. Buddy Holly had one more year to live. The music you were born into was already changing by the time you could appreciate it.</p><p>Your childhood was soundtracked by the British Invasion. You were five when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan. Suddenly, every kid wanted a guitar and a mop-top haircut. The Rolling Stones followed. Then The Who. Then everyone else. By the time you were a teenager, Woodstock happened, and music became something more than entertainment—it became identity.</p><p>TV raised you as much as your parents did. You grew up on Leave It to Beaver, The Twilight Zone, Bonanza, and whatever else came through the antenna. Saturday morning cartoons were appointment viewing. The Flintstones premiered when you were two. By the time you were a teenager, All in the Family was teaching America to argue about politics at the dinner table.</p><p>Movies meant drive-ins and double features. You were ten when 2001: A Space Odyssey confused everyone's parents. Eleven when Easy Rider made motorcycles seem revolutionary. Thirteen when The Godfather proved movies could be art and entertainment simultaneously. Hollywood grew up with you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Explorer 1 became America's first satellite, launched in desperate response to Sputnik. NASA didn't exist when you were born in January. By July, it did. The space race defined the technology of your childhood—everything was rockets, astronauts, and the promise of the future.</p><p>The first commercial jet, the Boeing 707, entered service in 1958. Your generation would grow up to be the first frequent flyers, shrinking the world in ways your parents' generation couldn't imagine. Air travel went from luxury to routine on your watch.</p><p>You were eleven when humans walked on the moon. You probably watched it live, grainy footage on a television set, and thought that by the time you were an adult, everyone would have flying cars and vacation on Mars. That didn't happen, but the optimism was intoxicating while it lasted.</p><p>The calculator in your pocket today has more computing power than existed on the entire planet when you were born. ENIAC, the first general-purpose computer, weighed 30 tons and could do 5,000 calculations per second. Your smartphone does billions. You've witnessed more technological change than any generation in human history.</p><p>You adapted to computers in middle age, which wasn't as hard as younger people assume. You learned email, then the internet, then social media. You text now. You might even use emojis. You're not as hopeless as your grandchildren think, but you're also not as fluent as they are. You remember when technology was optional. They don't.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born into the Cold War's permanent simmer. The Soviet Union was the enemy, nuclear war was always possible, and schoolchildren practiced hiding under desks as if particle board would stop radiation. This anxiety was the weather of your childhood—always there, rarely discussed directly.</p><p>You were five when Kennedy was assassinated. Seven when the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam from advisory mission to full-scale war. Ten when King and Kennedy were killed. Twelve when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Your childhood pinballed between tragedy and triumph, often within the same year.</p><p>Vietnam shaped your generation more than any other event. You were draft age in 1976—late enough to miss combat, but not late enough to miss the anxiety. The boys a few years older than you went. The boys a few years younger didn't have to worry. You were stuck in the middle, watching a war end badly while Saigon fell on television.</p><p>You were sixteen during Watergate. You watched a president lie, deny, and eventually resign in disgrace. The lesson was clear: institutions were fallible, leaders were corruptible, and 'I am not a crook' was destined to become an ironic catchphrase.</p><p>You were twenty-three when Reagan was elected, launching the conservative revolution that would reshape American politics for the next forty years. You were twenty-nine when the Challenger exploded. Thirty-one when the Berlin Wall fell. Forty-three when the towers came down on 9/11. Fifty during the 2008 financial crisis. History didn't pause for you to catch your breath.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the late 1970s and early 1980s, depending on your education path. If you went straight to work after high school, you caught the tail end of manufacturing jobs that paid middle-class wages without requiring college degrees. If you went to college, it cost a fraction of what it costs today—you could work summers and pay tuition, a fantasy now.</p><p>Your career coincided with the transition from industrial economy to information economy. Factories closed. Offices opened. The jobs that existed when you started working don't exist anymore, and the jobs that exist now didn't exist when you started. You've adapted through multiple technological revolutions—typewriters to word processors to computers to smartphones—or you've been left behind.</p><p>You're the generation that invented the 'Organization Man' and then killed him. Early in your career, loyalty meant something—you stayed at one company, they took care of you, everyone retired with a pension. By the time you hit middle management, that contract was being rewritten. Layoffs, downsizing, restructuring—the euphemisms piled up as job security evaporated.</p><p>If you're still working, you're probably being asked why you haven't retired yet. If you've retired, you're probably working part-time anyway because pensions aren't what they used to be and Social Security doesn't stretch as far as promised. The retirement your parents had isn't the retirement you're getting.</p><p>You've spent four decades watching younger workers enter the job market with different expectations. They want work-life balance. They want meaning. They want flexibility. You wanted those things too, but you didn't think you could ask for them. Whether that's admirable discipline or unnecessary suffering depends on your perspective.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You grew up in the era of formal courtship that was already falling apart by the time you started dating. Your parents expected you to go steady, meet the family, follow a script. The sexual revolution had other ideas. By the time you were in college, the rules had been rewritten—or thrown out entirely.</p><p>You probably married younger than your children did. The average age of first marriage for your generation was early to mid-twenties. You bought houses, had kids, and settled into adult life by ages that would terrify millennials. Whether that was wisdom or naivety is still up for debate.</p><p>Divorce rates peaked during your generation's prime marrying years. The stigma that kept your parents' generation in unhappy marriages didn't apply the same way. You were free to leave—and many of you did. Some marriages improved. Some fell apart. Everyone got practice navigating blended families and co-parenting arrangements.</p><p>Communication meant phone calls, letters, and showing up in person. Long distance was expensive—you budgeted for it, kept calls short, wrote letters that took days to arrive. When you wanted to reach someone, you had to work for it. Relationships required effort in ways that seem quaint now.</p><p>You've watched your children and grandchildren navigate dating apps, text-based relationships, and communication styles that would have baffled you at their age. You've adapted—you text, you video chat, you probably have opinions about read receipts. But you remember when presence was physical, not digital, and you're not sure the new way is better.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You entered adulthood during stagflation—that miserable combination of high inflation and economic stagnation that shouldn't have been possible according to the textbooks. Interest rates hit 20% in 1980. Mortgages were impossible. The economy that had lifted your parents into the middle class seemed broken.</p><p>Then it got better. The 1980s and 1990s were boom times. If you bought a house when they were affordable, you watched its value multiply. If you invested in the stock market, you rode the longest bull run in history. If you stayed employed, your wages actually grew. The economy worked for you in ways it doesn't work for younger people now.</p><p>Your generation accumulated wealth in ways your children can't replicate. You bought houses when the median price was three times the median income. Now it's eight times. You paid for college with summer jobs. Now it requires mortgaging your future. The ladder you climbed has been pulled up behind you—not deliberately, but effectively.</p><p>You've lived through enough economic crises to know stability is an illusion. The 1970s recession. The 1987 crash. The dot-com bust. The 2008 financial crisis. COVID. Each time, the experts said nobody could have predicted it. Each time, the pain fell hardest on people with the least margin for error. You've learned to keep reserves, pay down debt, and never trust that good times will last.</p><p>Retirement planning has been your generation's obsession and anxiety. The pension your father got doesn't exist anymore. Social Security might not be there when you need it most. 401(k)s transfer all the risk to you. You've spent decades trying to save enough, never quite sure what 'enough' means. The goalposts keep moving.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is the assumption that your experience is universal. You worked hard and succeeded, therefore anyone who works hard should succeed. The economy you entered isn't the economy that exists now. The college you could pay for with a summer job now costs a year's salary. The house you bought for $50,000 is worth $500,000. The math is different, but you sometimes forget.</p><p>You grew up in a world where institutions worked—imperfectly, but they worked. Government, corporations, churches, schools—they mostly did what they were supposed to do. That trust was already eroding by the time you hit middle age, but you still expect younger generations to respect institutions they've only seen fail.</p><p>Your generation stayed in charge longer than any before it. Boomers have dominated politics, business, and culture for decades. The torch-passing that happened naturally for previous generations has stalled. Whether that's because you're uniquely capable or uniquely unwilling to let go depends on who's asking.</p><p>You have complicated relationships with the social changes that happened on your watch. Many of you marched for civil rights and against the war. Many of you didn't. The split in your generation never healed—you're still fighting the culture wars that started in the 1960s, still arguing about the same issues with the same intensity, fifty years later.</p><p>Technology frustrates you more than you'd like to admit. You've adapted to every new platform, learned every new device, but there's a fatigue that comes from constant change. You remember when things stayed the same for decades. Now everything updates quarterly. You're tired of learning, even if you're still capable of it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1978-1988):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation, gas lines, and the Iran hostage crisis. The optimism of your childhood had curdled. You took whatever job you could get, started families earlier than your children would, and watched Reagan reshape American politics. This was supposed to be your decade of possibility. Instead, it was a decade of adjustment.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1988-1998):</strong> The economy improved. If you'd bought property, it started appreciating. If you'd invested, your portfolio grew. You hit your stride professionally, raised kids, and believed the American Dream was still intact—just harder to reach than your parents made it look. The Cold War ended. Everything seemed possible again.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1998-2008):</strong> This was your peak earning decade. Kids were in school or leaving for college. Career advancement meant more responsibility, more money, more stress. You started thinking about retirement as something real rather than theoretical. The dot-com bust stung, but recovery came quickly. Then 2008 hit, and everything you'd built felt precarious again.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2008-2018):</strong> The financial crisis reshaped your retirement plans. Portfolios crashed. Housing values collapsed. Some of you lost jobs you thought were secure. The recovery took years, and by the time it arrived, you were closer to retirement than you wanted to be with less money than you needed. You worked longer than you'd planned because you had to.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2018-2028):</strong> Retirement became real—or didn't, because you couldn't afford it. You're navigating health insurance until Medicare kicks in, Social Security optimization strategies, and the question of whether your savings will outlast you. Your parents lived into their eighties. You might live into your nineties. Nobody planned for that much retirement.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2028+):</strong> You're the generation that redefined old age. Seventy doesn't look like it used to. You're healthier, more active, and more engaged than your grandparents were at this age. But you're also more financially anxious, more politically polarized, and more disconnected from younger generations who don't understand why you won't just retire already. The world is unrecognizable from the one you were born into. Whether that's progress or decline depends on the day.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.2 million people born in 1958. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US, making you the largest generation in American history until Millennials eventually overtook you by total numbers—though you've maintained dominance in wealth and political power.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you're more rebellious, more questioning, and more likely to have protested something. They accepted the institutions you challenged. They trusted the government you learned to doubt. They retired with pensions you'll never see. They were grateful for stability. You demanded change.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more optimistic—or more naive, depending on perspective. You believed the system could work if you pushed hard enough. Gen X watched Watergate, Vietnam, and economic stagnation and concluded the system was broken. They're cynical in ways you never quite managed. They're also the generation you forgot existed, sandwiched between your dominance and Millennial visibility.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. You controlled 21% of the nation's wealth when you were their age. They control 7%. You bought houses when they were affordable. They're drowning in student debt you didn't have. You got pensions. They got 401(k)s. The economy worked for you in ways it doesn't work for them, and they're not sure you understand that.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. You remember when technology was optional. They've never known a world without smartphones. You trusted institutions that have failed them repeatedly. You're optimistic about incremental change. They're skeptical that the system can be reformed at all.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've already exceeded that. Modern medicine, improved lifestyle awareness, and pure luck have extended Boomer lifespans into the eighties and beyond. You're living longer than any generation before you—and spending more time in retirement than anyone anticipated, which creates its own financial and social complications.</p>"
