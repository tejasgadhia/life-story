      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1984-1996</h2><p>You were born the year Apple aired the most famous Super Bowl commercial ever made—a sledgehammer through Big Brother's screen, promising that '1984 won't be like <em>1984</em>.' George Orwell's dystopia was supposed to be fiction. The Macintosh was supposed to save us. Jury's still out on both.</p><p>Ronald Reagan won re-election in a landslide that November, carrying 49 states. The Cold War was the background hum of your early years—nuclear annihilation wasn't a hypothetical, it was a thing you practiced for by hiding under your desk. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were seven. You remember Gorbachev's face on the news but not what it meant.</p><p>Your childhood straddled two worlds. You had a rotary phone, then a cordless phone, then a family computer that took up half the desk. Saturday morning cartoons were non-negotiable. If you wanted to rent a movie, you went to Blockbuster and argued with your siblings about what to pick. The internet existed by the time you hit middle school, but it involved a modem screech that made everyone in the house curse.</p><p>You were eleven when Oklahoma City happened, twelve when JonBenét Ramsey's face was everywhere, fourteen during Columbine. Your childhood was punctuated by tragedies that adults couldn't explain, broadcast on a 24-hour news cycle that was just learning how to profit from fear. The Cosby Show defined family television for your early years, which feels complicated now for obvious reasons.</p><p>Your toys were simple by today's standards—action figures, Barbies, board games, the NES if you were lucky. Screen time was limited by the number of screens that existed, which wasn't many. You played outside because there was nothing better to do indoors. Boredom was just something you lived with.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996 by Pew Research's now-canonical definition. At 1984, you're right in the thick of it—not an 'elder Millennial' clinging to Gen X nostalgia, not a younger Millennial who barely remembers life before smartphones. You're core Millennial, for better or worse.</p><p>Your generation is roughly 72 million people in the US. You were the largest living generation until Gen Z started catching up. Being a large cohort meant intense competition—for college spots, for jobs, for housing. There were always more of you than there were opportunities.</p><p>The defining moment for your generation was 9/11. You were seventeen. Old enough to drive, old enough to be thinking about college applications, old enough to understand that the world just fundamentally broke. Everything after that day—the wars, the security theater, the perpetual anxiety—happened during your most formative years.</p><p>You graduated into the 2008 financial crisis or its shadow. The economy you were promised didn't exist. Entry-level jobs required three years of experience. Unpaid internships were 'opportunities.' The gig economy wasn't freedom—it was desperation rebranded as flexibility.</p><p>Your generation got blamed for killing industries, for being entitled, for not buying houses or having kids on schedule. The truth is simpler: you can't buy what you can't afford. The ladder your parents climbed got pulled up before you reached it.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year <em>Ghostbusters</em> asked 'Who you gonna call?' and <em>The Terminator</em> promised he'd be back. <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> made Eddie Murphy the biggest star on the planet. <em>Footloose</em> convinced a generation that dancing in a barn was an act of rebellion.</p><p>Prince's <em>Purple Rain</em> dominated everything. Madonna was becoming Madonna. Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the U.S.A.' got misinterpreted as patriotic anthem by people who didn't listen past the chorus. Band Aid recorded 'Do They Know It's Christmas?'—the original celebrity charity single, before charity singles became exhausting.</p><p>Television in 1984 was peak network dominance. The Cosby Show premiered and immediately became the most-watched show in America. <em>Miami Vice</em> started teaching men how to dress badly with confidence. <em>Night Court</em> was appointment viewing. Cable existed but was a luxury most families didn't have yet.</p><p>Your childhood was defined by the late-'80s and early-'90s content boom. You grew up with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, and whatever was on Nickelodeon. Your musical awakening probably happened during grunge—Nirvana's <em>Nevermind</em> dropped when you were seven, which means you experienced 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as a kid who didn't understand it and then again as a teenager who thought it understood you.</p><p>By high school, you were swimming in TRL, boy bands versus Britney, and the early emo/punk revival scene. You had strong opinions about *NSYNC versus Backstreet Boys. You probably owned a Discman that skipped constantly. You might have burned CDs with handwritten tracklists on the cover.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the same year as the Macintosh—January 24, 1984. The Apple II was old news. IBM PCs were for offices. Home computers were expensive curiosities that mostly ran games and word processors. Nobody knew yet that these beige boxes would eventually run everything.</p><p>The internet, in 1984, was still ARPANET—a military and academic network connecting a few thousand computers. The World Wide Web wouldn't exist for another five years. Email was something professors used. The idea of carrying a computer in your pocket would have seemed like science fiction.</p><p>You were eleven when Windows 95 launched and suddenly computers made sense to normal people. You were fourteen when Google started in a garage. Seventeen when Napster taught everyone that music could be free if you didn't mind waiting three hours to download one song. Nineteen when the iPod made carrying 1,000 songs in your pocket feel like magic.</p><p>Facebook opened to college students when you were twenty. The iPhone launched when you were twenty-three. By then, you'd lived roughly half your life without ubiquitous internet and half with it. This makes you bilingual in a way younger people aren't—fluent in both analog and digital, comfortable with both.</p><p>You remember what boredom felt like before smartphones filled every empty moment. You remember having to wait to know things. You remember getting lost because you didn't have GPS, finding your way using actual maps or asking strangers for directions. These aren't just nostalgia—they're cognitive experiences younger generations literally cannot comprehend.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were five months old when the Bhopal disaster killed thousands in India—the worst industrial accident in history. You don't remember it, but it set the template for how corporations handle catastrophic failure: deny, delay, minimize, settle for pennies.</p><p>You were five when the Berlin Wall fell. Seven when the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War that terrified your parents ended before you were old enough to fully fear it. You inherited a world that was supposed to be 'post-history,' where liberal democracy had won forever. That didn't quite work out.</p><p>You were eleven when the Oklahoma City bombing happened. This was domestic terrorism before we had a framework for it. You were twelve when TWA Flight 800 exploded and conspiracy theories went mainstream. You were fourteen when Columbine happened and school became a place where you practiced hiding.</p><p>You were seventeen during 9/11. You remember where you were. You probably watched the second plane hit live. You saw the towers fall. The adults in your life didn't have answers because there weren't any. The wars that followed—Afghanistan, Iraq—began during your senior year of high school and were still going when you hit thirty.</p><p>You were twenty-four during the 2008 financial crisis. You were either freshly graduated or about to be, and the job market had evaporated. The 'real world' your parents told you about was a smoking crater. Economic security became a joke you told to cope.</p><p>By thirty, same-sex marriage was legal. By thirty-two, Donald Trump was president. By thirty-six, there was a global pandemic. You've lived through 'unprecedented' events so often that precedent seems like a quaint concept from a simpler time.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the mid-2000s, which means you had about three good years before the 2008 crisis destroyed everything. If you graduated in 2006, you might have found your footing before the floor collapsed. If you graduated in 2008 or later, you walked straight into the worst job market since the Great Depression.</p><p>Your generation invented 'side hustles' because one job didn't cover rent. You drove for Uber, sold on Etsy, freelanced on nights and weekends—not because you wanted to, but because the full-time job with benefits that your parents took for granted didn't exist anymore.</p><p>You've had more jobs than your parents had in their entire careers. This isn't disloyalty—it's survival. Companies stopped offering pensions, stopped giving meaningful raises, stopped pretending they valued employees as humans. Job-hopping became the only way to increase your salary.</p><p>You've sat through countless meetings about 'company culture' while watching executives take bonuses during layoffs. You've been told you're 'like family' by organizations that would fire you without a second thought. You learned early that employment is transactional, even when they pretend otherwise.</p><p>Remote work became normalized during COVID, which was the silver lining on a very dark cloud. You proved you could work from anywhere, which means you're now expected to work from everywhere. The laptop on your kitchen table doesn't close. The Slack messages don't stop. Work-life balance is a myth you stopped believing in years ago.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You probably had your first real relationship before dating apps existed. You met people in person—at school, at work, at parties, through friends. There was no algorithm. You had to approach someone and risk rejection in real-time, which built character or created trauma, depending on how it went.</p><p>Tinder launched when you were twenty-eight or twenty-nine. By then, you'd already done relationships the old way. The swipe-based sorting of human connection felt both efficient and dystopian. You probably tried it. You probably had opinions about it.</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage longer than any before. Not because you didn't want partnership, but because weddings cost $30,000 and houses cost $400,000 and you were still paying off student loans. The life script your parents followed required money you didn't have.</p><p>You communicate primarily through text, which is weird if you think about it—you grew up calling people on phones, actually talking, voice to voice. Now a phone call feels like an emergency. You've had entire relationships mediated through screens. You've broken up via text. You've fallen in love via DM.</p><p>Maintaining friendships across distance became normal because everyone you knew moved for work, for school, for cheaper rent. Group chats replaced geographic proximity. You're closer to people thousands of miles away than neighbors you've never met. Connection became digital by necessity, not preference.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were sixteen during the dot-com crash. Twenty-four during the 2008 financial crisis. Thirty-six during the COVID economic collapse. You've watched the economy implode three times before middle age. This has consequences for how you think about money, stability, and the future.</p><p>Your financial psychology is defined by scarcity that never quite ends. You graduated with student debt that was supposed to be 'worth it' and discovered the math didn't work. You watched housing prices climb 200% while your wages moved maybe 30%. The gap between what you have and what you need to feel secure keeps widening.</p><p>You save compulsively because you've seen how fast everything can disappear. You don't trust the stock market because you've watched it crash multiple times, but you invest anyway because Social Security is a question mark and savings accounts earn nothing. You're playing a rigged game because not playing guarantees losing.</p><p>Boomers owned 21% of national wealth at your age. Millennials own 7%. This isn't a lifestyle difference—it's a structural robbery that happened while people lectured you about avocado toast. The generational wealth gap will define your entire economic life.</p><p>Financial success, for your generation, has been redefined. It's not a house in the suburbs—it's not being crushed by rent in a city where the jobs are. It's not retiring at 65—it's hoping you can stop working before your body forces you to. Your expectations have been managed downward because reality left you no choice.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation optimizes everything. Steps, sleep, calories, screen time—you've turned self-improvement into a productivity system. The problem is you can't hack your way out of systemic failures. No amount of personal optimization fixes a broken economy, a collapsing climate, or a healthcare system designed to bankrupt you.</p><p>You've adapted to dysfunction so thoroughly that you forget to question whether the dysfunction should exist. You've normalized precarity. You've accepted that healthcare requires employment, that education requires debt, that retirement is maybe never. You've learned to survive within broken systems instead of demanding those systems be fixed.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that hurt you. You've been trained to be 'team players,' to 'bring solutions not problems,' to manage up and never rock the boat. This makes you easy to exploit. You'll work unpaid overtime for 'experience.' You'll accept equity in a startup worth nothing because asking for cash feels greedy.</p><p>Your irony and self-deprecation have become shields that prevent genuine advocacy. You can't just want something—you have to want it ironically, or want it while acknowledging its problematic aspects, or frame wanting it as a joke. This makes it hard to fight for yourself without hedging.</p><p>You're so online that you sometimes mistake digital action for real action. You can mobilize hashtags, but voting rates still lag. You can cancel celebrities, but changing policy requires showing up to school board meetings. The dopamine hit of online outrage feels like progress even when nothing actually changes.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (2004-2014):</strong> The first half was promising—the economy was humming, jobs existed, optimism felt reasonable. Then 2008 happened and everything collapsed. Your twenties became about survival: taking jobs you were overqualified for, moving back home, delaying adulthood because adulthood was unaffordable. The decade that was supposed to be about exploration became about economic triage.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2014-2024):</strong> This decade involved picking up the pieces. You probably made more money than before, but it still felt precarious. Housing prices kept climbing faster than your salary. You watched younger colleagues enter the workforce with different expectations—more cynical, more demanding, more willing to quit. You were stuck between generations, too established to start over, too insecure to relax. If you had kids, you did so later than your parents did. If you didn't, you fielded endless questions about when.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2024-2034):</strong> You're entering this decade now. Statistically, this should be your peak earning period. You'll have more authority, more clarity, more 'figured out' than before. But you'll also be sandwiched: aging parents who need help, kids (if you have them) who need resources, your own needs perpetually deferred. This is the decade where you either solidify what you've built or make dramatic changes because time is running out to start over.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2034-2044):</strong> By now, you'll be the elder statesperson at work, mentoring people who don't remember the pre-smartphone world. Your parents will be in their late 70s or 80s, requiring decisions about care. Retirement will be a calculation: Can you afford to stop? Probably not entirely. You'll work longer than your parents did because the economics require it.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2044+):</strong> Traditional retirement isn't in the cards for most of your generation. It'll be part-time work, consulting, gig economy participation well into your late 60s. Climate change will have reshaped geography. Technology will have changed in ways currently unimaginable. You'll tell stories about rotary phones, VHS tapes, and a time when you couldn't look anything up instantly. Younger generations won't believe any of it.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.7 million people born in 1984. The entire Millennial generation numbers about 72 million in the US—the largest generation until Gen Z finishes growing.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more educated and significantly worse off financially. Gen X caught the tail end of affordable college, stable employment, and pensions that actually existed. They got the last tickets on a train that stopped running before you reached the station.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the wealth disparity is almost comical if it weren't devastating. Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth at your age. You control 7%. They bought houses for $50,000 that are now worth $800,000. They retired with defined pensions. You're hoping 401(k) contributions and compound interest somehow make up the difference.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you share similar struggles but different starting assumptions. You remember when things were supposed to work. Gen Z never had that illusion. You adapted to smartphones; they were born into them. You learned to code-switch between analog and digital; they're digital-only. You're the last generation that remembers the before times.</p><p>Your life expectancy is 78-80 years, slightly lower than Boomers due to rising 'deaths of despair'—suicide, overdose, alcohol-related illness. Your generation reports worse mental health outcomes than any before. You're more anxious, more depressed, more medicated.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more aware of systemic inequality, and more committed to changing it. You've normalized therapy, fought for marriage equality, and pushed conversations about race, gender, and climate further than any generation before. The world got harder on your watch, but you're trying to make it fairer. That's something.</p>"
