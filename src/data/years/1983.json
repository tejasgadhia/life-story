      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year Return of the Jedi closed out the original Star Wars trilogy and the M*A*S*H finale drew 105 million viewers—the largest audience for a single TV episode in American history. Ronald Reagan was calling the Soviet Union an 'evil empire.' The Cold War was very much still cold. And somewhere in West Germany, a Korean Air Lines flight got shot down by Soviet jets, killing 269 people and reminding everyone that nuclear annihilation remained a genuine possibility.</p><p>Your childhood was the last gasp of the analog world, but you caught it in time to remember what it felt like. Card catalogs at the library. Encyclopedia Britannica as the arbiter of facts. Calling your friends' houses and talking to whoever picked up. You didn't have a phone in your pocket because phones were bolted to walls and had curly cords that never quite untangled.</p><p>You were three when the Challenger exploded. You might remember it, or you might remember remembering it—adults crying, teachers turning off the classroom TV. You were six when the Berlin Wall fell, old enough to sense that something big had happened even if you couldn't articulate what. You were eight when the Soviet Union collapsed entirely, which meant the existential threat your parents grew up with simply evaporated overnight.</p><p>The Gulf War happened when you were seven or eight—yellow ribbons and CNN footage and a conflict that seemed to be over almost as soon as it started. You probably had a 'Support Our Troops' sticker somewhere. Desert Storm was the first war designed for television, and you were the right age to absorb its sanitized imagery without understanding what you were really seeing.</p><p>Your childhood pop culture was defined by oversized everything: hair, shoulder pads, attitudes. You grew up on Saturday morning cartoons before streaming made them obsolete. Nintendo was the center of your social universe. The Walkman was freedom—your own music, your own world, clipped to your belt. You probably had a Trapper Keeper and strong opinions about Lisa Frank.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Michael Jackson moonwalked for the first time and Thriller became the best-selling album in history. MTV was two years old and still played music videos. Every kid in America wanted a red leather jacket with too many zippers. Jackson was inescapable—on the radio, on TV, at school dances, in your nightmares after watching that transformation scene.</p><p>Return of the Jedi wrapped up the Star Wars trilogy the year you were born. By the time you were old enough to watch it, the original films were already sacred texts. You experienced them on VHS, probably taped off TV with commercials you didn't bother fast-forwarding through. You didn't need to wait in line for a premiere—the movies were already classics, already part of the cultural furniture.</p><p>The M*A*S*H finale aired in February 1983. It was the end of an era, though you'd have to watch the reruns to understand why it mattered. That show ran eleven seasons about a three-year war, and people cried when it ended like they were losing real friends. Television used to mean something different when everyone watched the same thing at the same time.</p><p>Your childhood soundtracks were wildly inconsistent. You caught the tail end of hair metal, the rise of grunge, the brief moment when swing music came back for no clear reason. You probably owned a cassette tape of something embarrassing—Vanilla Ice, maybe, or the Macarena single. Your teenage years were Nirvana, then Britney, then boy bands, then whatever Napster put in front of you for free.</p><p>Television in your formative years meant Saved by the Bell, Full House, and whichever TGIF lineup ABC was pushing that season. You learned about relationships from shows where problems got solved in 22 minutes and everybody hugged at the end. Reality didn't work that way, but nobody told you until you were already grown.</p><p>Your generation was the last to experience pop culture as a shared monoculture. Everyone saw the same movies, watched the same shows, heard the same songs. The internet hadn't yet splintered attention into a million algorithmic niches. There was a before-internet and an after-internet, and you remember both.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Motorola released the first commercial mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000x—a $3,995 brick that weighed two pounds and offered 30 minutes of talk time. Only Wall Street types and doctors had them. The idea that everyone would carry a phone in their pocket seemed like science fiction, which is exactly what it was.</p><p>Compact discs went mainstream in 1983. Your parents probably didn't buy a CD player until the late '80s, which meant your early music memories were cassettes and maybe vinyl if your family was old-school. You experienced the CD revolution as a child, watching shiny discs replace magnetic tape, not understanding you'd eventually abandon both for files that didn't physically exist.</p><p>The internet, such as it was, existed when you were born—ARPANET had been running since 1969. But it was military and academic, nothing that touched civilian life. You were twelve when Windows 95 launched and made personal computing accessible to people who didn't know what a command line was. You were sixteen when Google started indexing the web. You were eighteen when Wikipedia launched, which meant you wrote research papers the old way—with library books and periodical indexes—before the democratization of information made that seem quaint.</p><p>You got your first email address in high school, probably through AOL or Hotmail. You learned to type by chatting on AIM, developing a fluency in instant messaging that would serve you well when texting became universal. You were twenty-four when the iPhone launched, old enough to remember what phones were supposed to be before Steve Jobs told everyone they were wrong.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is generationally unique. You're old enough to remember card catalogs and young enough to take for granted that all human knowledge fits in your pocket. You can troubleshoot both a VCR and a smartphone. You bridge the analog and digital worlds in a way younger people genuinely cannot comprehend—they've never known anything else.</p><p>Social media arrived when you were already an adult. Facebook opened to the public when you were twenty-three. Twitter launched the same year. You adopted these platforms as finished adults, not as teenagers whose personalities were still forming. This gives you a perspective Gen Z doesn't have: you know what life felt like before the like button.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after launch, killing all seven crew members including teacher Christa McAuliffe. Schools across America had tuned in to watch the first civilian in space. Instead, they watched seven people die on live television. It was probably your first encounter with the idea that the world could break, suddenly, without warning.</p><p>You were six when the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989. You were old enough to sense the excitement but too young to understand the geopolitics. The Cold War had been the background radiation of your parents' entire lives. For you, it was just something that ended around the time you started first grade. You grew up without the nuclear anxiety that defined previous generations.</p><p>You were eight when the Soviet Union formally dissolved. The superpower that had defined global politics for forty-five years simply stopped existing. By the time you were paying attention to current events, there was only one superpower left, and you lived in it.</p><p>You were twelve when the Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people. You were fourteen when Princess Diana died and the world watched her funeral. You were sixteen when Columbine happened—the school shooting that created the template for everything after. You probably had your first lockdown drill not long after. The idea that schools needed active shooter protocols became normal during your adolescence.</p><p>You were eighteen on September 11, 2001. You were an adult, or close enough. You watched the towers fall live, probably in a college dorm or at your first job. You saw people jump. The before-and-after of that day split your life in two. Everything that came next—the wars, the security theater, the permanent state of vague fear—happened during your formative adult years.</p><p>You were twenty-five when the 2008 financial crisis hit. You were entering your peak earning years just as the economy collapsed. You watched friends lose jobs, homes, futures. The recession shaped your career trajectory in ways you're probably still feeling. You learned early that economic stability was a myth.</p><p>You were thirty-seven when COVID-19 shut down the world. You were established enough to work from home, probably, but not so established that the disruption didn't matter. You learned to teach your kids over Zoom, or you isolated alone, or you kept going to work because someone had to. The pandemic was just the latest in a lifetime of destabilizing events that weren't supposed to happen but kept happening anyway.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 2005, give or take. The dot-com bust had cleared, the economy was humming along, and things seemed reasonably stable. You probably got a job, started climbing whatever ladder existed in your field, and believed—briefly—that hard work would be rewarded with security. The 2008 financial crisis disabused you of that notion with ruthless efficiency.</p><p>You were twenty-five when Lehman Brothers collapsed and took the economy with it. If you'd been working for a few years, you watched colleagues get laid off. If you were job hunting, you discovered that entry-level positions suddenly required five years of experience. The recession didn't just cost jobs—it cost belief in the system that was supposed to provide them.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the grim art of the 'side hustle' because primary hustles didn't pay enough. You've probably worked jobs that called themselves 'opportunities' instead of 'employment,' which meant they came with exposure instead of benefits. You learned that passion was something employers wanted you to have so they could pay you less for having it.</p><p>You're old enough to remember when job loyalty meant something. Companies used to keep employees for decades, offer pensions, provide actual job security. By the time you started working, that contract had been shredded. You've never expected an employer to be loyal to you because none of them ever were. Job-hopping isn't disloyalty—it's rational self-defense in a labor market that treats workers as disposable.</p><p>You've sat through more terrible meetings than you can count. You've endured open office plans designed to foster collaboration that actually fostered constant distraction. You've been told to 'lean in' while the table kept getting moved. You've watched companies preach work-life balance while sending emails at 11 PM expecting responses.</p><p>Remote work became normalized because of COVID, which was a silver lining on a very dark cloud. You proved you could do your job from anywhere. Employers discovered they could expect you to do your job from everywhere, all the time, with no clear boundary between work and not-work. The commute disappeared; the expectation of constant availability replaced it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were twelve when the dot-com bubble burst. You were twenty-five when the 2008 financial crisis nearly ended capitalism. You were thirty-seven when COVID crashed the global economy. By the time you're fifty, there will probably have been another crash or two. You've been conditioned to expect economic collapse the way previous generations expected the sun to rise.</p><p>Your financial worldview is defined by watching the rules change after you learned them. You were told to go to college, so you went to college and accumulated debt. You were told homeownership was the path to wealth, so you tried to buy a home while prices tripled. You were told to invest in your 401(k), so you watched your retirement savings evaporate in 2008 and again in 2020.</p><p>The wealth gap between you and the generation before you is genuinely obscene. Boomers owned 21% of the nation's wealth when they were your age. Your generation owns a fraction of that. They bought houses for a year's salary. You're paying a year's salary in rent. They retired with pensions. You're hoping Social Security survives long enough to matter.</p><p>You save obsessively because you've seen how fast stability disappears. You're skeptical of the stock market because you've watched it crash twice during your adult life, but you invest anyway because the alternatives are worse. You're playing a game you know is rigged because not playing means losing by default.</p><p>Your generation delayed every traditional milestone because the economics didn't work. Marriage, kids, homeownership—these aren't choices you rejected. They're choices that got priced out of reach. You're not a generation that doesn't want things. You're a generation that wants things it can't afford.</p><p>The lecture about avocado toast and lattes comes from people who don't understand that skipping brunch wouldn't make a down payment appear. The math doesn't work. Housing costs more, wages are flat, and compound interest works against you when you're in debt. You're not bad with money. You're operating in an economy designed to extract wealth from people who don't already have it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You started this decade with optimism and ended it in an economic crater. The 2008 financial crisis landed when you were twenty-five—old enough to have started building something, young enough to watch it collapse. You took jobs you were overqualified for. You moved back home or lived with too many roommates. You delayed marriage, kids, homeownership—not by choice, but by math. This was supposed to be your 'finding yourself' decade. Instead, it was your 'surviving the Great Recession' decade.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> You probably made more money than you did at twenty-five, but it still didn't feel like enough. You watched housing prices climb while your savings stagnated. You were supposed to 'settle down' but settling felt like surrender. You might have gotten married, had kids, bought a house—or you might have decided those things weren't for you, or weren't for you yet. Either way, you spent this decade trying to build stability on a foundation that kept shifting. COVID hit when you were thirty-seven, upending whatever normal you'd managed to construct.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> This is your peak earning decade, statistically. You have more authority at work, more clarity about what you want, more acceptance of what you can't change. Your kids, if you have them, are getting older. Your parents are aging, which brings responsibilities you didn't anticipate. You're sandwiched between generations, managing everyone's needs while your own get back-burnered. This is the decade where you either double down on the life you've built or blow it up and start over. Both are valid.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> By now, you've lived through at least four economic crises, probably two pandemics, and countless events labeled 'unprecedented' that seem to happen every other year. You'll be pre-retirement age but unable to retire because retirement isn't financially viable. You'll mentor younger people who don't understand why you're so scarred by 2008. You'll catch yourself sounding like the older generations you used to resent, and you'll understand why they were the way they were.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_START}}+):</strong> Retirement, if you can afford it, won't look like your parents' retirement. Part-time work, gig economy participation, or reliance on kids who are struggling themselves—these are the options. Social Security might exist in some form. Climate change will have reshaped where people live. You'll tell younger people about life before smartphones, before ubiquitous internet, before everything got recorded and uploaded. They'll look at you the way you looked at grandparents describing party lines and ice boxes—with polite disbelief that anyone lived that way.</p>"
