      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year the Beatles broke up, which is either poetic or tragic depending on how much you care about Paul McCartney's bass lines. Nixon was in the White House. Vietnam was on every television. The Kent State shooting happened four weeks before your first birthday. Welcome to America.</p><p>Your childhood was the 1970s, which looked nothing like the sanitized nostalgia of That '70s Show. The economy was garbage—stagflation, oil embargoes, gas lines that stretched for blocks. Your parents probably drove a wood-paneled station wagon and argued about whether they could afford to run the air conditioning. The mustard yellow and avocado green color scheme of your childhood kitchen wasn't retro chic. It was just how things looked.</p><p>You were a latchkey kid before anyone called it that. Mom went to work because one income wasn't cutting it anymore. You came home to an empty house, made yourself a snack, and watched television until someone got home. Your supervision consisted of neighbors who might or might not notice if you set something on fire. Helicopter parenting hadn't been invented yet. Neither had the term 'free-range kids.' You were just kids.</p><p>The cultural backdrop of your childhood was paranoia. Watergate. The Pentagon Papers. The revelation that the government had been lying about Vietnam for years. Your parents learned not to trust authority around the same time they were teaching you to respect it. The mixed messages were constant and confusing.</p><p>You watched the Bicentennial on TV when you were six. You saw Star Wars in theaters when you were seven—probably multiple times, because there wasn't home video yet and if you wanted to see it again, you bought another ticket. Disco was everywhere. Punk was rising. The culture was fragmenting in ways that would define your generation's relationship with mainstream anything.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Gen X</h2><p>You're Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980. The name came from a Douglas Coupland novel that nobody actually read but everyone referenced. You're roughly 65 million people in the US, sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials. The forgotten middle child of American generations.</p><p>Your generation invented irony as a defensive posture. When everything is performative, nothing can hurt you. You watched your parents' idealism curdle into divorce courts and cocaine habits. The '60s promised revolution. The '70s delivered malaise. You learned early that sincerity was a setup for disappointment.</p><p>The defining trait of Gen X is self-reliance, which is a polite way of saying nobody was paying attention to you. Your parents were too busy working, divorcing, or finding themselves to supervise your childhood. You raised yourselves on TV dinners and MTV. You figured things out because no one was coming to help.</p><p>You're the last generation to grow up without the internet, smartphones, or social media. Your adolescence happened offline. Your embarrassing moments weren't recorded and uploaded. Your mistakes weren't searchable. This gives you a privacy baseline that younger generations can't imagine.</p><p>Gen X gets labeled as cynical, disaffected, slackers. The slacker thing was always overblown—your generation works as hard as anyone. But the cynicism is real. You've watched too many institutions fail to believe any of them have your best interests at heart. You're loyal to people, not organizations. You've seen what happens to loyalty in the other direction.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year the Beatles released Let It Be and promptly imploded. Simon & Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' was everywhere. So was the Jackson 5. Your birth year's soundtrack was the end of one era and the messy beginning of another.</p><p>In cinema, 1970 gave us Patton, M*A*S*H, and Love Story. The film industry was between the collapse of the old studio system and the rise of New Hollywood. Within a few years, Coppola and Scorsese would remake American cinema. You'd be old enough to appreciate Taxi Driver and The Godfather by the time they showed up on cable.</p><p>Your childhood was defined by television in ways previous generations couldn't understand. You watched Sesame Street and The Electric Company. You learned your ABCs from Muppets. Saturday morning cartoons were a religion. School House Rock taught you more about how a bill becomes a law than your civics class ever did.</p><p>Your teenage years belonged to MTV, which launched when you were eleven. You watched Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video premiere like it was a moon landing. You saw Madonna roll around on stage at the VMAs. You witnessed hair metal, new wave, and hip-hop emerge simultaneously. Music became visual in ways that rewired how your generation consumed culture.</p><p>The movies of your adolescence were John Hughes films that captured suburban teen alienation with suspicious accuracy. The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. These weren't just entertainment—they were mirrors. You recognized yourself in those detention rooms and shopping malls. You quoted those films because they said things you couldn't articulate yourself.</p><p>By the time you hit your twenties, grunge had killed hair metal, Nirvana had made angst respectable, and Quentin Tarantino was reinventing dialogue. Your generation's aesthetic was flannel shirts, doc martens, and the studied casualness of people trying very hard to look like they weren't trying at all.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born in a world of rotary phones, three TV channels, and typewriters. The pocket calculator was revolutionary technology. The idea of a personal computer was science fiction. The internet didn't exist in any form you'd recognize.</p><p>Your childhood technology was analog everything. You changed the TV channel by walking to the television. You looked things up in encyclopedias. Your parents kept address books written in pen. Information moved slowly, and that slowness shaped how you think about research, communication, and patience.</p><p>The VCR arrived when you were about seven, and it changed everything. Suddenly you could record shows. You could watch movies at home. The concept of time-shifting—watching what you want when you want—was revolutionary. You were probably twelve before your family figured out how to stop the clock from blinking 12:00.</p><p>Personal computers entered your life in adolescence. Maybe an Apple II at school, a Commodore 64 at home if your parents were early adopters. You learned BASIC because that's what computers spoke. You played Oregon Trail and died of dysentery a hundred times. The graphics were terrible and the experience was magical.</p><p>The internet arrived when you were in your twenties. You remember dial-up, the screech of a modem connecting, the wait for images to load line by line. Email replaced letters. Search engines replaced the library. The world shrank, slowly at first, then all at once.</p><p>You adapted to technology but weren't born into it. You can troubleshoot a computer and program a VCR (if you can find one). You learned new systems as they emerged—the web, smartphones, social media—but you remember the before times. You're bilingual: fluent in both analog and digital worlds. This makes you invaluable for explaining things to Boomers and translating for Millennials.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were four when Nixon resigned. You probably don't remember it directly, but you absorbed the aftermath—the way your parents talked about politics, the betrayal that hung in the air. Watergate became shorthand for every scandal that followed. Adding '-gate' to any controversy is your generation's linguistic inheritance.</p><p>You were five during the fall of Saigon, watching helicopters evacuate the embassy on the evening news. Vietnam ended not with victory but with chaos and abandonment. This was your first lesson in how wars actually end: badly, with no clear winners, and with consequences that lasted decades.</p><p>You were sixteen when the Challenger exploded. You probably watched it live in your classroom. Christa McAuliffe was supposed to be the first teacher in space. Instead, she became a cautionary tale about institutional failure and the gap between American ambition and American execution. That image—the Y-shaped smoke trail against blue sky—is burned into your memory alongside every other Gen Xer's.</p><p>You were nineteen when the Berlin Wall fell. You watched people take sledgehammers to concrete while newscasters tried to explain what it meant. The Cold War, which had defined your entire life, ended not with a bang but with confused Germans hugging each other on top of rubble. The Soviet Union collapsed two years later. The existential threat of your childhood simply evaporated.</p><p>You were thirty-one on 9/11. Old enough to have a career, a life, maybe a family. Old enough to feel the before and after in your bones. You knew adults who died that day. You watched the towers fall and knew immediately that everything would change. The security state that emerged—the surveillance, the wars, the fear—became the backdrop of your middle age.</p><p>You were thirty-eight during the 2008 financial crisis. You'd built something by then: equity in a house, a 401(k), maybe some stability. You watched it collapse. Housing values cratered. Retirement accounts halved. The job market imploded. You were old enough to survive it, young enough to wonder if you'd ever recover. Some of you didn't.</p><p>You were fifty when COVID hit. You were the demographic that wasn't quite high-risk but wasn't quite safe. You zoomed through a pandemic while worrying about aging parents and adult children simultaneously. The world shut down, and you discovered that working from home was either liberating or suffocating, depending on your living situation.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around {{WORKFORCE_ENTRY_YEAR}}, give or take a few years depending on education. The economy was stumbling out of recession. Jobs existed but weren't plentiful. You took what you could get and figured you'd work your way up. That was still how it worked back then—loyalty and tenure meant something.</p><p>Your career spanned the transition from analog to digital everything. You started with typewriters and fax machines. You ended with Slack and Zoom. You've written memos, emails, and texts about the same kinds of workplace problems. The medium changed; the human dysfunction remained constant.</p><p>You watched corporate culture transform from lifetime employment to layoffs-as-strategy. The social contract between workers and employers disintegrated on your watch. Pensions became 401(k)s. Job security became a punchline. You learned to keep your resume updated because loyalty was a one-way street that dead-ended in a severance package.</p><p>By your forties, you were senior enough to manage people and strategic enough to understand how the game worked. You'd survived multiple economic downturns, multiple rounds of layoffs, multiple corporate reorganizations that somehow always eliminated the people doing actual work while preserving the people scheduling meetings about work.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the concept of work-life balance, mostly by demonstrating what happens when there isn't any. You watched Boomers work themselves into heart attacks and decided that wasn't for you. You wanted to actually see your kids grow up. This made older generations call you lazy. You called it having perspective.</p><p>Now you're in your fifties, staring down a retirement that may or may not be financially viable. You've got another decade or two of work in you, probably. Whether that's by choice or necessity depends on factors largely outside your control—healthcare costs, Social Security solvency, whether the economy decides to implode again. You're too experienced to hire, too young to retire, and too tired to start over.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that grew up with a 50% divorce rate. Half your friends' parents split up. Maybe yours did too. You learned early that marriages end, families fracture, and 'till death do us part' was more aspiration than guarantee. This made you cautious about commitment in ways previous generations weren't.</p><p>You met partners the old-fashioned way: in person, through friends, at bars, at work. No apps, no algorithms, no swiping. You had to actually talk to people, which was terrifying but also meant you developed social skills that younger generations learned to outsource to technology.</p><p>Your communication evolved with the technology. You started with landlines and answering machines. You remember the anxiety of calling someone and not knowing who would pick up. You remember leaving messages and waiting hours or days for callbacks. Patience wasn't a virtue—it was just how things worked.</p><p>Email changed everything in your twenties. Suddenly you could communicate in writing, asynchronously, without the commitment of a phone call or the delay of mail. You adapted quickly because you had to. Your workplace ran on email. Your friendships migrated there too.</p><p>Texting and social media arrived when you were already formed. You use them, but they don't define you the way they define younger generations. You can put the phone down. You remember what it's like to be unreachable. You occasionally miss it.</p><p>Your generation married later than Boomers but earlier than Millennials. You had kids later too—if you had them at all. The economic uncertainty of your early career years delayed traditional milestones. By the time you could afford a family, you weren't sure you wanted one. Some of you did. Some of you didn't. Both choices were valid in ways they weren't for your parents.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You grew up during stagflation, gas crises, and economic malaise. Your childhood taught you that prosperity wasn't guaranteed. You watched your parents struggle with inflation that outpaced wages, mortgage rates that topped 18%, and an economy that seemed permanently stuck in neutral.</p><p>You entered adulthood expecting less than your parents had. This turned out to be accurate, though not quite in the ways you anticipated. You've made more money in nominal terms but bought less with it. Housing, healthcare, and education all cost more, adjusted for inflation, than they did when your parents were your age.</p><p>Your financial life has been a series of recoveries from economic catastrophes. The early '90s recession. The dot-com bust. The 2008 financial crisis. Each one set you back. Each one taught you that stability was temporary and planning was provisional.</p><p>You save more than Millennials because you remember when there wasn't a safety net. You invest more cautiously than Boomers because you've watched markets crash repeatedly. Your portfolio is probably diversified to the point of mediocrity because you're more afraid of losing everything than missing out on gains.</p><p>Your relationship with debt is complicated. You came of age when credit was easy and consequences were deferred. Some of you used that responsibly. Some of you didn't. Either way, you've spent decades managing, paying down, and occasionally drowning in debt that seemed manageable at the time.</p><p>Retirement looms larger now. You can do the math. Social Security might cover rent, if you're lucky. Your 401(k) might cover groceries. The pension your father had doesn't exist anymore. You'll work longer than you planned because the alternative is poverty. This isn't pessimism—it's arithmetic.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: you're so self-reliant that you've forgotten how to ask for help. You bootstrapped your way through life because nobody was coming to save you. But now that collective action is necessary—for climate change, for political reform, for institutional change—you're not sure how to do it. You're great at individual survival. You're less great at collective struggle.</p><p>You've spent so long being cynical that you've lost the ability to be earnest about anything. Irony is your default mode. Sincerity feels dangerous, naive, like setting yourself up for disappointment. But some things require earnestness. Some fights require believing that change is possible. Your protective detachment becomes a prison when hope is actually required.</p><p>You dismiss younger generations for being soft, coddled, too online. But they're dealing with problems you didn't have to face—climate anxiety, algorithmic manipulation, a job market that makes yours look functional. Your 'I figured it out, so can they' attitude ignores that the game has changed. The rules that worked for you don't apply anymore.</p><p>You've normalized overwork to the point where you can't recognize it anymore. You're proud of your hustle, your grind, your ability to function on minimal sleep and maximum caffeine. But that's not resilience—it's dysfunction dressed up as virtue. You've confused being busy with being valuable.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is becoming a liability. You're digital immigrants, not natives. You adapted well, but the world is moving faster now. Your kids understand platforms you've never heard of. Your workplace uses tools that didn't exist five years ago. You're not obsolete yet, but the gap between your skills and the cutting edge is widening. Continuous learning isn't optional anymore—it's survival.</p><p>You're in the sandwich generation—caring for aging parents while supporting adult children who can't afford to launch. This is exhausting, but you've internalized the exhaustion so completely that you don't complain about it. You should. The system that put you here is broken, and your silence about it perpetuates the dysfunction.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1990-2000):</strong> You came of age as the Cold War ended and the internet began. You got jobs, lost jobs, got different jobs. You figured out who you were in a decade of economic expansion and cultural fragmentation. Grunge, then dot-com optimism. AIDS crisis, then antiretroviral hope. You learned that nothing lasted—not the bad times, not the good times.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2000-2010):</strong> You watched 9/11 redefine America. You built careers, maybe families, definitely some debt. You bought houses at exactly the wrong time or got priced out entirely. You entered 2008 thinking you'd made it. You exited wondering if you'd ever feel secure again. This decade taught you that middle-class stability was an illusion.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2010-2020):</strong> Recovery, of a sort. You rebuilt what 2008 destroyed. Your kids got older; your parents got frailer. You achieved career peaks while your body started its slow decline. You developed opinions about cholesterol, sleep quality, and whether your back would cooperate with basic activities. You entered middle age and discovered it was exactly as advertised: exhausting.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2020-2030):</strong> You're here now, navigating the aftermath of a pandemic and the uncertainty of everything else. Your expertise is valuable; your energy is finite. You're mentoring younger workers who don't understand why you're so paranoid about job security. You're planning for retirement while suspecting the numbers won't work. You're watching your parents' generation decline and confronting your own mortality in ways that feel too soon and too real.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2030-2040):</strong> This is the decade where you'll decide—or have decided for you—how the last act goes. Retirement, if you can afford it. Consulting, if you can't. Grandchildren, maybe. The slow process of letting go of career identity and figuring out what comes next. Your health will matter more than your ambition. Your relationships will matter more than your resume.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2040+):</strong> You'll be the generation that remembers the 20th century firsthand. You'll tell stories about a world without internet, without smartphones, without the surveillance state. Younger people won't believe you. You'll watch technologies emerge that you can't comprehend. You'll hope the planet is still livable, that democracy survives, that the grandkids inherit something worth having. You've survived this much. You'll survive a little longer.</p>"

The entire Gen X generation is about 65 million people in the US, making you the smallest generation since the Silent Generation. You're literally overlooked—there just aren't as many of you.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), you're smaller, quieter, and significantly less wealthy. Boomers had numbers and used them—they dominated culture, politics, and the economy. You grew up in their shadow and stayed there. They got cheap housing, good pensions, and cultural dominance. You got their leftovers and their problems.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're less educated but wealthier. You entered the workforce before the economy completely collapsed. You bought houses before they became unaffordable. You're not rich, but you're richer than they are, on average. They'll inherit from Boomers eventually; you're the generation that gets skipped in the wealth transfer.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're ancient history. They don't remember a world before smartphones. You don't understand half their slang. The cultural gap is wider than it was with Millennials because technology accelerated the change. You're the last generation to know what boredom felt like before screens filled every empty moment.</p><p>Your life expectancy is 78-80 years, roughly similar to Boomers but with different health profiles. You've got higher rates of obesity and lower rates of smoking. You're more medicated—for depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, chronic conditions your parents ignored until they killed them. Modern medicine keeps you alive; it doesn't necessarily keep you healthy.</p><p>Your generation's defining trait is adaptation without complaint. You watched institutions fail, economies collapse, and promises break. You adjusted. You survived. You didn't organize massive protests or demand systemic change—you just figured out how to live within broken systems. Whether that's resilience or resignation depends on who's asking.</p>"
