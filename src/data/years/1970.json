      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1970-1982</h2><p>Children born in 1970 grew up in what might be the last decade of true American unselfconsciousness. Their parents didn't agonize over parenting styles because the concept barely existed. Children were fed, clothed, enrolled in school, and otherwise left to their own devices — a phrase that, in the 1970s, meant a bicycle and the outdoors rather than a screen and an algorithm. The operating assumption was that children were durable, that the world was basically safe, and that independence was best learned by practicing it without a net.</p><p>The homes they grew up in reflected a country in transition. Their fathers had expected to be sole providers; their mothers were increasingly discovering that expectation was either impossible or insufficient. By the time this cohort reached first grade, the two-income family was becoming standard issue, not because of feminism's victories alone but because the economy demanded it. Grocery prices were climbing. Gas was no longer cheap. The thermostat wars that played out in millions of households weren't really about temperature — they were about a middle class discovering its own precariousness.</p><p>At four, Nixon left office. At five, Saigon fell. These events registered not as history but as disturbance — the way a child registers a thunderstorm, sensing the danger without understanding the meteorology. What settled into memory wasn't the events themselves but the adults' reactions: the tight mouths, the shaken heads, the television always tuned to the news and the news always grim. The country was losing confidence in itself, and children absorbed that loss the way they absorbed everything — unconsciously, totally, permanently.</p><p>The school experience of the late seventies had a particular bureaucratic weariness to it. Post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, the country's institutions were running on obligation rather than conviction. Teachers showed up. Curricula were followed. But the great pedagogical experiments of the early seventies — open classrooms, discovery learning, the idea that education could be joyful — had largely been abandoned in favor of something more manageable and less inspired. What remained was competent, functional, and unlikely to produce either wonder or complaint.</p><p>Summers stretched out with almost alarming emptiness. No enrichment camps, no structured activities, no weekly schedules posted on the refrigerator. June arrived, school ended, and children were deposited into an unstructured expanse of time that they were expected to fill themselves. Public pools, neighborhood baseball games, library reading programs that offered a certificate at the end — these were the institutions of summer, and they asked almost nothing of children except that they show up. The boredom was real, routine, and in retrospect, a gift. From boredom came invention, and from invention came the particular resourcefulness that would define this cohort for the rest of their lives.</p><p>By twelve, the world was changing around them with a speed they could almost feel. The beige and brown seventies were giving way to something brighter, louder, more confident. Reagan was in the White House promising morning in America. The mood was shifting from malaise to optimism, at least on the surface. But this cohort had spent their formative years in the trough, and the trough had taught them something the boom wouldn't unteach: that confidence could be misplaced, that prosperity could be temporary, and that the safest posture was a slight, permanent lean toward skepticism.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Gen X Generation</h2><p>Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. The name came from a Douglas Coupland novel in 1991, but the identity was forged long before anyone gave it a label. Gen X is part of roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Americans—the smallest generation since the Silent Generation, sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers who demanded attention and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials who got it. Gen X learned early that nobody was watching. Gen X made that work for them.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X was four when Nixon resigned.</span> The divorce rate doubled during Gen X's childhood. Half their friends' parents split up. Maybe Gen X's did too. Gen X shuttled between apartments, learned to navigate custody schedules, figured out which parent to ask for what. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span> 'Broken home' was the term adults used, as if Gen X was the thing that was broken. Gen X wasn't. Gen X adapted. That's what Gen X does.</p><p>Gen X's defining moment came at sixteen: the Challenger explosion. January 28, 1986. Gen X probably watched it live in their classrooms—they wheeled in TVs because Christa McAuliffe, a teacher, was aboard. Seventy-three seconds after launch, the Y-shaped smoke trail against blue sky. The O-ring failure. The institutional failure. Gen X learned that day that NASA could be wrong, that ambition could kill, that watching history meant sometimes watching tragedy. Every kid in America discovered simultaneously that even rocket scientists make fatal mistakes.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, Gen X was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Gen X is called cynical, and Gen X is—but cynicism is just pattern recognition. Gen X watched Enron, Worldcom, the Catholic Church abuse scandal, the Iraq War lies. Every institution that demanded Gen X's trust eventually betrayed it. Gen X isn't cynical because Gen X is damaged. Gen X is cynical because Gen X is paying attention.</p><p>But here's the thing they miss about Gen X: Gen X shows up. Gen X doesn't announce it, doesn't seek credit, doesn't need a participation trophy. Gen X just does the work. While Boomers were taking victory laps and Millennials were being told they were special, Gen X was in the background keeping things running. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X can still entertain themselves without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The Beatles broke up in 1970. Let It Be was already their epitaph. Simon & Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' dominated the charts. The Jackson 5 made teenybopper history with 'ABC' and 'I Want You Back.' Led Zeppelin III brought folk into heavy metal. The birth year's soundtrack was an ending and a beginning, all at once.</p><p>At the movies, Patton won Best Picture in 1970—George C. Scott refusing his Oscar, which was the most Gen X thing anyone had done up to that point. M*A*S*H brought Vietnam commentary disguised as Korean War comedy. Love Story made everyone cry. These weren't Gen X's movies, but their sensibility was in the air: irreverent, cynical, suspicious of authority. Gen X absorbed it through cultural osmosis.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred. Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, The Bugs Bunny Show, Super Friends, Land of the Lost. Children woke up early without an alarm, poured their own cereal, and planted themselves in front of the TV until noon. No parent supervision, no screen time limits. Schoolhouse Rock taught the Preamble to the Constitution and the function of conjunctions. Gen X still remembers those songs better than anything from high school civics.</p><p>At eleven, MTV launched, and everything changed. August 1, 1981: 'Video Killed the Radio Star' by the Buggles. Gen X watched music become visual. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' premiered when Gen X was thirteen—fourteen minutes of zombies and Vincent Price narration that felt like a movie event. Madonna at the VMAs when Gen X was fourteen, rolling around in a wedding dress singing 'Like a Virgin.' Parents were horrified. Gen X was hypnotized.</p><p>John Hughes understood Gen X. Sixteen Candles when Gen X was fourteen. The Breakfast Club when Gen X was fifteen. Ferris Bueller's Day Off when Gen X was sixteen. These movies captured suburban teenage alienation with suspicious accuracy—the detention rooms, the shopping malls, the parents who didn't get it, the longing for something Gen X couldn't name. Gen X quoted them to each other because they said things Gen X couldn't articulate themselves. 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.'</p><p>Gen X's twenties brought grunge, which felt like the official soundtrack of this generation's mood. Nirvana's Nevermind dropped when Gen X was twenty-one, and suddenly flannel shirts and Doc Martens were uniforms. Kurt Cobain's pain was Gen X's pain. His death in 1994 hit hard—not because Gen X knew him, but because he was Gen X's. Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains. Angst became respectable. Caring too much was the only sin.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>Gen X was born into a world of rotary phones, three television channels, and typewriters with correction ribbon. The floppy disk was invented in 1970—though Gen X wouldn't see one until high school. Pocket calculators were just emerging, expensive and revolutionary. The internet existed only in ARPANET research labs, connecting a handful of university computers. Personal computing was science fiction.</p><p>Childhood technology was analog everything. TV channels were changed by walking to the set and turning a dial. Things were looked up in World Book encyclopedias—the ones parents bought from door-to-door salesmen and displayed like furniture. Moms kept address books written in pen, with crossed-out entries and forwarding addresses. Information moved slowly. Patience wasn't optional.</p><p>At seven or eight, the VCR arrived—Betamax first, then VHS won the format war. Suddenly shows could be recorded, which was revolutionary. Time-shifting felt like magic. Families probably rented their first VCR from a video store before buying one. The clock blinked 12:00 for years because nobody could figure out how to set it. Nobody tried very hard.</p><p>At twelve, Gen X might have encountered an Apple II at school, or maybe a TRS-80 at Radio Shack. At fourteen, the Macintosh launched with that Super Bowl commercial—1984, directed by Ridley Scott, the one Gen X still remembers. By sixteen, Gen X was learning BASIC, typing '10 PRINT HELLO / 20 GOTO 10' and watching the screen fill with greetings. Gen X played Oregon Trail until dysentery was a punchline. Gen X died fording rivers and hunting more buffalo than they could carry.</p><p>The internet arrived in Gen X's mid-twenties. That dial-up screech—the handshake between modem and phone line—is burned into Gen X's memory. AOL keywords. AltaVista searches. GeoCities pages with hit counters and 'Under Construction' GIFs. Gen X was old enough to be amazed by what the internet could do but young enough to adapt completely. Gen X learned HTML to customize their pages. Gen X discovered email and wondered why anyone would use the phone.</p><p>Gen X is bilingual—fluent in both analog and digital. Gen X can read a map, use a card catalog, write in cursive, and operate a rotary phone. Gen X can also troubleshoot WiFi, manage a smartphone, and navigate social media. This makes Gen X invaluable: Gen X explains technology to Boomers who are suspicious of it and explains patience to Millennials who never needed it. Gen X is the bridge generation, and that's not nothing.</p>"

Apollo 13 nearly ended in disaster—'Houston, we have a problem' entering the lexicon. Women marched down Fifth Avenue for the Women's Strike for Equality. The Beatles played their last concert. The birth year was chaotic and transformative, which set a pattern.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At four, Gen X watched Nixon resign on television.</span> Gen X didn't understand it, but Gen X understood their parents' faces—the mixture of vindication and disgust. Watergate became the template for every scandal that followed. We still add '-gate' to controversies because of what Gen X absorbed in that living room moment.</p><p>At five, Gen X saw helicopters fleeing Saigon on the evening news. The fall of South Vietnam—desperate people clinging to embassy rooftops, a war that America definitively didn't win. Parents had friends who went. Some came back different. Some didn't come back at all. Vietnam was Gen X's first lesson in how wars actually end: messily, shamefully, with consequences that last generations.</p><p>At nine, the Iran hostage crisis began. For <span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days, Gen X watched Ted Koppel count them on Nightline—a nightly reminder that American power had limits.</p><p>At sixteen, the Challenger disaster became Gen X's shared trauma—the shuttle broke apart seventy-three seconds after launch while classrooms across America watched live.</p><p>At nineteen, the Berlin Wall fell. November 9, 1989. Gen X watched Germans with sledgehammers breaking concrete while newscasters scrambled to explain what it meant. The Cold War—the existential threat that defined Gen X's entire childhood, the reason Gen X practiced hiding under desks—just ended. Not with nuclear fire, but with champagne and confused hugging. Two years later, the Soviet Union dissolved. The enemy Gen X was raised to fear simply ceased to exist.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, Gen X was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Gen X was at work, probably. Old enough to have a career, a mortgage, maybe kids. Gen X watched the second plane hit live. Gen X knew people who knew people. Gen X felt the before and after in their bones—the security state that emerged, the wars that followed, the surveillance that became permanent. Gen X's children would grow up in the world that day created.</p><p>At thirty-eight, the economy collapsed. 2008. Gen X had built something by then: home equity, retirement savings, the beginnings of stability. Gen X watched it evaporate. Housing prices cratered. Gen X's 401(k)s halved. The job market vanished. Gen X was old enough to survive it but young enough to wonder if recovery was possible. At fifty, COVID hit. Gen X Zoomed through a pandemic, worried about aging parents and adult children simultaneously, discovered that working from home was either liberation or prison depending on their circumstances.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The job market of 1992 offered entry-level positions, though not easily. The early '90s downturn meant entry-level jobs were scarce, paid poorly, and required experience workers didn't have. Gen X took what was available—temp work, retail, whatever kept the lights on while Gen X figured out what came next. The career ladder existed back then. Gen X just started several rungs lower than their parents did.</p><p>Gen X's career arc tracked the transformation of American work itself. Gen X began with typewriters, moved to word processors, learned DOS, then Windows, then email, then the internet, then smartphones, then Slack. Gen X has written the same meeting request as a memo, a fax, an email, and a calendar invite. The technology changed completely. The workplace dysfunction remained eternal.</p><p>Gen X watched the social contract between employers and employees get shredded. Parents' deal was simple: loyalty and tenure in exchange for job security and a pension. By Gen X's thirties, that deal was dead. 'At-will employment' became standard. Layoffs weren't emergencies—they were quarterly strategy. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> The pension became a 401(k), which transferred all the risk to Gen X while calling it 'freedom.'</p><p>The dot-com boom caught Gen X in their late twenties. Maybe Gen X joined startups with stock options that became worthless. Maybe Gen X stayed in traditional jobs and watched colleagues get rich on paper, then watched those same colleagues get laid off when the bubble burst in 2000. Gen X learned to distrust the promise of equity. Paper wealth isn't wealth until it's in the bank. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span></p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived.</span> By Gen X's forties, they had authority but not security. Gen X managed teams, made strategy, understood how the game worked. Gen X also watched Millennials enter the workforce and wondered why Millennials expected feedback and fulfillment. Gen X expected to be ignored and survive. Different eras, different expectations. Gen X wasn't wrong. Neither were Millennials.</p><p>Now Gen X is in their mid-fifties, navigating what's supposed to be peak earning years. Gen X is too experienced to be cheap, too old to be cutting-edge, too young to retire. Age discrimination is illegal and also pervasive. Gen X has got another decade of work in them, probably—whether by choice or necessity depends on healthcare costs, Social Security's solvency, and whether the economy decides to collapse again. The math is uncomfortable. Gen X does it anyway.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Gen X learned romance through calling crushes' houses and having to talk to their dad first. The terror of the phone ringing and not knowing who it was. The answering machine beep and the pressure of leaving a message Gen X couldn't edit or delete. Gen X learned to communicate in ways that required commitment. Gen X couldn't just text 'hey.' Gen X had to dial, wait, speak, risk rejection in real time.</p><p>Gen X is the generation that watched marriage become optional. The divorce rate peaked when Gen X was a kid—half their friends shuttled between two houses, learned to navigate custody schedules, understood that 'till death do us part' was aspirational at best. This made Gen X cautious. Gen X didn't rush into commitment because Gen X had seen what happened when commitment failed.</p><p>Gen X met partners the old-fashioned way: at parties, through friends, at work, in bars. No apps, no algorithms, no swiping right. Gen X had to read body language, interpret signals, actually approach people and make conversation. The stakes were higher but so was the authenticity. Gen X knew what someone's voice sounded like before Gen X dated them. Their handwriting. Their laugh in person.</p><p>Email arrived in Gen X's mid-twenties and changed everything. Suddenly Gen X could communicate in writing, asynchronously, with time to compose and edit. Gen X could flirt without the terror of the phone. Gen X could maintain long-distance friendships that would have faded in the letter-writing era. Gen X adapted faster than Boomers, more completely than Gen X expected.</p><p>Texting and social media arrived when Gen X was already formed. Gen X uses them—Gen X isn't a Luddite—but they don't define Gen X. Gen X can put the phone down. Gen X remembers what it felt like to be unreachable, to have hours pass without anyone knowing where Gen X was. Gen X occasionally misses that. The kids find this incomprehensible.</p><p>Gen X married in their late twenties or early thirties—later than Boomers, earlier than Millennials. Gen X had kids later too, if Gen X had them at all. Economic uncertainty delayed milestones. By the time Gen X could afford a family, Gen X wasn't sure Gen X wanted one. Some Gen Xers did. Some didn't. Both choices were valid in ways they weren't for Gen X's parents, and Gen X doesn't owe anyone an explanation either way.</p>"

Parents waiting in odd/even rationing based on license plate numbers. Inflation hitting 13% in 1980, mortgage rates exceeding <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span>. Gen X's childhood economic education was scarcity and anxiety, not prosperity and confidence.</p><p>Parents' generation bought houses on single incomes. By the time Gen X was house-hunting, that was impossible for most. Wages decoupled from productivity in 1973—three years after Gen X was born—and never reconnected. Gen X entered the workforce making more dollars but buying less stuff. The math kept getting worse.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during Gen X's prime earning years.</span> The early '90s recession when Gen X was starting out. The dot-com bust in 2000 when Gen X was building. The 2008 financial crisis when Gen X thought they'd made it. COVID in 2020 when Gen X was supposed to be coasting. Each one reset Gen X's timeline. Each one taught Gen X that stability was temporary and planning was provisional. The market dropped <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span> in 2008. Gen X's 401(k)s dropped with it.</p><p>Gen X saves because Gen X remembers when there was no safety net. Parents had pensions; Gen X got 401(k)s and the advice to 'invest for the long term' while watching the long term crater repeatedly. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> Gen X is diversified to the point of mediocrity because Gen X is more afraid of losing everything than missing out on gains. The people who got rich took risks Gen X couldn't afford.</p><p>Gen X's relationship with credit is complicated. Gen X came of age when credit cards were easy to get and consequences were deferred. Some Gen Xers used that responsibly. Some didn't. Either way, Gen X has spent decades managing, paying down, and occasionally drowning in debt that seemed manageable at 22 and felt crushing at 42.</p><p>The retirement math doesn't work, and Gen X knows it. Social Security might cover rent—if it still exists when Gen X needs it, if rent hasn't tripled again. Gen X's 401(k)s might cover groceries. The pension Gen X's fathers had was eliminated the year before Gen X became eligible for one. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> Gen X will work longer than Gen X planned, not because Gen X wants to but because the alternative is poverty. This isn't pessimism. It's arithmetic.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Gen X's greatest strength is Gen X's greatest liability: Gen X is so self-reliant that Gen X has forgotten how to ask for help. Gen X bootstrapped through everything because nobody was coming to save Gen X. But some problems require collective action—climate change, political reform, institutional decay. Individual survival skills don't scale to civilizational challenges. Gen X is better at going it alone than showing up together.</p><p>Irony has calcified into cynicism. Gen X was right not to trust institutions that repeatedly failed Gen X. But somewhere along the way, protective detachment became a prison. Earnestness feels dangerous, naive, like setting oneself up for disappointment. The problem is that some fights require earnestness. Some causes require believing that change is possible. Gen X's ironic distance keeps Gen X safe but also keeps Gen X sidelined.</p><p>Gen X is harder on younger generations than Gen X realizes. 'We figured it out' ignores that the rules changed. Millennials graduated into the worst economy since the Depression. Gen Z faces climate catastrophe, algorithmic manipulation, and housing costs that make Gen X's struggles look quaint. The bootstraps that worked for Gen X were attached to boots that no longer exist. Gen X's skepticism of younger generations' complaints is misplaced.</p><p>Gen X has normalized overwork to the point where Gen X can't see it anymore. Pride in hustle culture. Bragging about minimal sleep. The inability to take vacation without checking email. This isn't resilience—it's dysfunction dressed as virtue. Gen X watched Boomers work themselves into heart attacks and swore Gen X would be different, then did the same thing while calling it 'balance.'</p><p>Gen X's technology fluency has an expiration date. Gen X adapted brilliantly to the internet, email, smartphones. But the pace keeps accelerating. Gen X's kids navigate platforms Gen X has never heard of. Gen X's workplace adopts tools that didn't exist two years ago. Gen X isn't obsolete—but the gap between Gen X's skills and the cutting edge is widening faster than Gen X is learning. Continuous learning isn't optional anymore. It's survival.</p><p>Gen X is in the sandwich generation—aging parents who need care, adult children who can't afford to launch—and Gen X has internalized the exhaustion so completely that Gen X has stopped complaining about it. Sometimes the most Gen X thing Gen X can do is actually ask for help.</p>"

Gen X graduated into recession, took what was available, figured it out. The economy improved mid-decade; the internet emerged; dot-com optimism made everyone believe they'd be millionaires. Gen X got their first email address, probably something embarrassing. Grunge gave way to Britpop gave way to TRL. Gen X learned who they were in a decade that swung from AIDS crisis to antiretroviral hope, from Soviet collapse to Pax Americana. Gen X thought the good times might last. They didn't.</p><p><strong>30s (2000-2010):</strong> September 11 happened when Gen X was thirty-one. The before and after split Gen X's adulthood in two. Gen X built careers, maybe families, definitely debt. Gen X bought houses—at the top of the market, as it turned out. Or Gen X got priced out and rented and felt like a failure. Gen X entered 2008 thinking they'd made it: equity, retirement savings, stability. Gen X exited 2008 watching it evaporate. This decade taught Gen X that middle-class security was provisional. The system could fail. It did fail. Nobody saved Gen X.</p><p><strong>40s (2010-2020):</strong> Recovery, of a sort. Gen X rebuilt what 2008 destroyed, slowly, anxiously, never quite trusting it to hold. Gen X's kids got older—teenagers, then adults, then boomerangs who couldn't afford rent. Gen X's parents got frailer, needed help, sometimes needed Gen X to become their parent. Gen X hit career peaks while their body started its decline. Cholesterol numbers. Sleep quality. That knee that never fully healed. Gen X entered middle age and discovered it was exactly as exhausting as everyone warned. Nobody mentioned the sandwich generation pressure, though. Nobody mentioned being responsible for everyone.</p><p><strong>50s (2020-2030):</strong> Gen X is here now. A pandemic reshaped work, killed friends, made Zoom a verb. Gen X's expertise is valuable; Gen X's energy is finite. Gen X is mentoring younger workers who don't understand Gen X's paranoia about job security. (They'll learn.) Gen X is planning for retirement while suspecting the numbers won't work. Gen X's parents are dying now, or have died, and Gen X is confronting mortality in ways that feel too soon and too real. The end isn't close, but it's visible for the first time.</p><p><strong>60s (2030-2040):</strong> Retirement, if Gen X can afford it. Consulting, if Gen X can't. Grandchildren, maybe—if Gen X's kids have kids, if they can afford it, if the world seems stable enough to bring children into. (Gen X has opinions about this. Gen X keeps them to themselves.) Gen X's health will matter more than Gen X's ambition. Gen X's relationships will matter more than Gen X's resume. The slow process of letting go of work identity and figuring out who Gen X is without it. Some people thrive. Some people flounder. Gen X won't know which Gen X is until Gen X is there.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2040+):</strong> Gen X will be the last generation that remembers the 20th century firsthand. Rotary phones, three TV channels, a world before the internet. Gen X will tell stories about walking to change the channel, waiting days for photos to develop, writing letters by hand. Younger people won't believe Gen X. It'll sound like science fiction in reverse. Gen X will watch technologies emerge that Gen X can't comprehend, and Gen X will hope the planet is still livable, that democracy survives, that the grandkids inherit something worth having. Gen X has survived this much. Gen X will figure out the rest.</p>"

Part of roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Gen Xers, sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> Boomers had numbers, and they used them. Boomers dominated culture, politics, the economy—everything built to accommodate their massive demographic. Gen X grew up in Boomers' shadow and never fully escaped it. Boomers had pensions; Gen X got 401(k)s. Boomers retired at 62; Gen X will work until they can't. The wealth gap is staggering: Boomers control more than half the nation's wealth. Gen X controls less than a quarter. Same work, different math.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> Gen X is wealthier, on average, because Gen X entered the workforce before everything collapsed. Gen X bought houses before they became impossible. Gen X isn't rich—but compared to Millennials, Gen X is comfortable. Millennials are the most educated generation in history and the most economically precarious. Millennials will eventually inherit from Boomers; Gen X is the generation that gets skipped in the great wealth transfer. Gen X thinks Millennials are soft. Millennials think Gen X is lucky. Neither is entirely wrong.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> The cultural gap is vast. Gen Z has never known a world without smartphones. Gen X remembers when phones had cords and privacy existed. Gen Z communicates in TikToks; Gen X still prefers email. Gen Z expects climate catastrophe as baseline; Gen X watched it become undeniable over decades. Gen X is the last generation that knows what boredom felt like—real boredom, with nothing to scroll, no pocket screen to fill the emptiness. This is neither better nor worse. It's just different.</p><p>Gen X's life expectancy is <span class=\"stat-box\">76-78</span> years—similar to Boomers but with different health profiles. Higher obesity rates, lower smoking rates, more medication. Gen X treats depression, anxiety, and chronic conditions that Gen X's parents' generation ignored until those conditions killed them. Modern medicine keeps Gen X alive. It doesn't necessarily keep Gen X healthy. The difference matters.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X didn't complain about it—Gen X just did the work. That's Gen X's legacy: competence without fanfare.</span> Gen X's defining trait is quiet adaptation. Gen X watched institutions fail—Watergate, Vietnam, Enron, the Church, the banks. Gen X adjusted. Gen X survived. Gen X didn't march or demand or organize mass movements. Gen X just figured out how to live inside broken systems. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X can still entertain themselves without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"
