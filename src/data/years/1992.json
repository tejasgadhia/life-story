      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1992-2004</h2><p>You were born the year Los Angeles burned, Bill Clinton won the presidency, and The Real World premiered—essentially inventing reality television and the surveillance culture that would define your adulthood. The Cold War had just ended. America was the unchallenged superpower. Everything felt possible, briefly.</p><p>Your childhood was the last gasp of analog. You had a landline with caller ID, which felt like magic. You rented movies from Blockbuster and argued with your siblings about late fees. If you wanted to know something, you looked it up in an encyclopedia or asked a librarian. Google launched when you were six, but it would be years before 'googling' became a verb.</p><p>You were five when Princess Diana died and the world collectively lost its mind. Nine during Columbine, which turned schools into places with active shooter drills and metal detectors. Nine during 9/11, which turned airports into security theater and the country into something angrier and more afraid.</p><p>Technology arrived in waves throughout your childhood. Your family's first computer probably had Windows 95 or 98. You played Oregon Trail and learned to type on Mavis Beacon. You got your first email address—probably something embarrassing with numbers in it—sometime in elementary school. AIM dominated your middle school years. MySpace owned high school. By the time Facebook arrived, you were already veterans of oversharing online.</p><p>Your childhood coincided with peak Saturday morning cartoons, Nickelodeon's golden era, and the Disney Renaissance's final act. You probably saw The Lion King in theaters. You definitely owned a Tamagotchi. You might have collected Beanie Babies with the seriousness of a Wall Street trader.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996. That's according to Pew Research, which settled the debate after years of people arguing about generational cutoffs. Your generation is about 72 million Americans, which made you the largest cohort until Gen Z started catching up in the late 2010s.</p><p>The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. You were nine. Old enough to watch the towers fall, young enough to have your worldview permanently shaped by the aftermath. Security checkpoints, forever wars, color-coded terror alerts—that became your normal. The pre-9/11 world is a foreign country you barely remember.</p><p>You graduated into either the Great Recession or its aftermath. The economy was a crater. Entry-level jobs required three years of experience. Unpaid internships were 'opportunities.' The gig economy wasn't freedom—it was desperation rebranded with app notifications.</p><p>Your generation gets blamed for killing industries, demanding participation trophies, and being simultaneously too optimistic and too pessimistic. In reality, you just graduated into the worst economy since the Depression, watched housing prices triple while wages stagnated, and got told your struggle was a character flaw.</p><p>Millennials are the bridge generation. You remember life before smartphones but can't imagine life without them. You're digital natives who know what dial-up sounds like. You're nostalgic for a past you barely experienced and anxious about a future that keeps getting worse.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Unforgiven won Best Picture and Clint Eastwood reminded everyone he could still act. Disney released Aladdin. Wayne's World brought SNL sketches to theaters and taught everyone to say 'Schwing!' and 'Party on.' Sister Act put Whoopi Goldberg in a nun's habit, which somehow worked.</p><p>Musically, 1992 was grunge's moment. Nirvana's Nevermind went platinum. Pearl Jam and Soundgarden were everywhere. In hip-hop, Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, which changed everything. Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' dominated radio for what felt like an entire year. Boyz II Men made everyone slow dance at middle school prom.</p><p>Television in 1992 was having a moment. The Real World invented reality TV—seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped—which seemed novel then and inescapable now. MTV still played music videos. Cartoon Network launched, giving you a dedicated channel for animation. The Tonight Show was still Johnny Carson's, but not for long.</p><p>Your childhood was Rugrats, Hey Arnold!, and Pokémon arriving like a cultural invasion. Your middle school years belonged to TRL, boy bands, and Britney vs. Christina debates that felt important. High school brought emo, MySpace profiles with carefully curated songs, and the early YouTube era when viral videos were still surprising.</p><p>The pop culture you absorbed was pre-algorithm. You couldn't skip ads. You couldn't binge shows—you waited a week between episodes and you liked it, sort of. Music came on physical CDs you bought at Best Buy. Movies you actually went to theaters to see. Culture was something you experienced on its schedule, not yours.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the first smartphone prototype appeared—IBM's Simon, a brick-sized device that nobody bought but that predicted everything that came later. The World Wide Web existed but wasn't public yet. Most people had never heard the word 'internet.' Personal computers were expensive beige boxes that ran DOS.</p><p>Windows 3.1 launched in 1992, which made PCs slightly less terrifying for normal people. The first text message was sent that year. Cell phones existed but were expensive, car-mounted, and used only by important people in movies. The idea that everyone would carry a pocket computer with a camera and constant internet was science fiction.</p><p>You were three when Windows 95 came out, complete with the Rolling Stones song and lines around the block at computer stores. You were six when Google launched. Twelve when the first iPod arrived. Fourteen when Facebook opened to high schools. Fifteen when the iPhone dropped. You didn't grow up with smartphones—you watched them colonize everything in real-time.</p><p>This makes you part of the last generation to remember life before the internet was mandatory. You know what boredom felt like before screens filled every empty moment. You printed MapQuest directions. You used a card catalog at the library. You can explain dial-up noises to younger people who don't believe you.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is complicated. You're digital natives who remember analog. You can troubleshoot both your parents' WiFi and your grandparents' VCR. You've watched social media go from fun to mandatory to exhausting. You understand that convenience comes at a cost—you just accepted the terms and conditions without reading them, like everyone else.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the LA riots, four days of chaos after the Rodney King verdict. America's racial tensions exploded on live television. Fifty-five people died. A billion dollars in property was destroyed. It was the first major civil unrest you existed during, though you wouldn't understand what it meant until much later.</p><p>You were one when the World Trade Center was bombed the first time. Eight years before the second, more successful attempt. You were three when the Oklahoma City bombing happened—domestic terrorism before we had language for it.</p><p>You were five when Princess Diana died in a Paris tunnel. The global mourning was unprecedented. Television covered nothing else for days. You probably didn't understand why the adults were so upset, but you learned that collective grief was a spectacle now.</p><p>You were seven when Columbine happened. School shootings existed before, but Columbine created the template. You probably had your first lockdown drill before fifth grade. Schools became places where you practiced hiding, not just learning.</p><p>You were nine during 9/11. You watched the towers fall, possibly in class. Teachers didn't know what to do. Parents picked kids up early. The world split into before and after. Everything that followed—the wars, the surveillance, the fear—happened during your formative years. You don't remember what airports were like before TSA.</p><p>You were fifteen during the 2008 financial crisis. Old enough to understand that something terrible was happening, young enough to inherit the consequences. College costs were skyrocketing. Jobs were disappearing. The economy you graduated into was a wasteland.</p><p>By your early twenties, Occupy Wall Street articulated what everyone felt but couldn't name. By your mid-twenties, same-sex marriage was legal nationwide. By twenty-four, Donald Trump won the presidency. By twenty-eight, there was a global pandemic. History kept happening, faster and worse than anyone expected. You've been alive for more 'unprecedented' events than any generation since your great-grandparents.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated into the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, sometime between 2010 and 2016 depending on your path. The job market was still recovering. Entry-level positions required years of experience. 'Networking' became a verb you used constantly but hated viscerally.</p><p>Your generation normalized the 'side hustle' because one income stream wasn't enough. You drove for Uber, sold things on Etsy, monetized hobbies that previous generations just did for fun. The gig economy wasn't liberation—it was survival dressed up in startup language.</p><p>You watched the workplace transform. Open offices replaced cubicles, which replaced offices, which were better. Standing desks appeared. Then everyone got back problems. Kombucha showed up in break room fridges alongside ping pong tables and 'unlimited PTO' policies that nobody actually used.</p><p>You're the generation that normalized job-hopping. Not because you're disloyal, but because companies stopped being loyal first. The implicit contract—work hard, get rewarded, stay for decades, retire with a pension—was already dead by the time you arrived. You learned to chase raises by leaving, not staying.</p><p>COVID reshaped everything. Remote work went from rare perk to standard practice. You proved you could be productive from home, which means employers now expect you to be productive from everywhere, all the time. The boundary between work and life dissolved. Your laptop became a coworker you couldn't escape.</p><p>You've been told to 'follow your passion' while watching passionate people burn out. You've been told to 'hustle' by people who inherited their positions. You've been told the economy is recovering while rent takes more of your paycheck every year. The career advice you received was written for a world that no longer exists.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that grew up with dating apps but still remembers meeting people in person. Tinder launched when you were about twenty-two. By the time you were actively dating as an adult, swiping was standard practice. Romance became a sorting algorithm you couldn't opt out of.</p><p>You probably met at least one significant partner online, which your parents find mildly concerning and your younger siblings find completely unremarkable. You're the bridge generation—old enough to remember asking someone out face-to-face, young enough to have normalized doing it through screens.</p><p>Your communication style evolved with the platforms. You started with AIM away messages, graduated to Facebook wall posts, migrated to texting, and now maintain relationships through a rotating cast of apps. You remember when calling someone was normal. Now it's suspicious. 'Why are you calling me? Is someone dead?'</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage, cohabitation, and children longer than any before. Not because you don't want these things, but because weddings cost $30,000, houses cost half a million, and childcare costs more than college tuition. The life script your parents followed isn't available at a price you can afford.</p><p>You've maintained friendships across geographic distance via group chats, social media, and occasional reunions. You've watched friend groups fragment as people moved for jobs, partners, or cheaper cities. You know how to feel close to people you rarely see in person and distant from people who live next door.</p><p>You've normalized therapy and talking about mental health in relationships. Previous generations suffered in silence. You suffer out loud, which is marginally better. You've learned that relationships require 'work,' which nobody told your grandparents, who just stayed married because divorce was expensive and embarrassing.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were eight when the dot-com bubble burst. Sixteen during the 2008 financial crisis. Twenty-eight during the COVID-19 economic collapse. You've watched the economy implode three times before hitting thirty-five. Your financial worldview is best described as 'waiting for the next crash.'</p><p>Your relationship with money is defined by never having quite enough. Student loans followed you into adulthood. Housing prices climbed faster than your income. The gap between where you are and where you were promised you'd be grows wider every year.</p><p>You save compulsively because you've seen stability evaporate overnight. You invest reluctantly, distrustful of markets that seem designed to extract wealth from people like you and transfer it to people unlike you. You play the game because opting out means losing by default.</p><p>You've been lectured about spending habits by people who bought houses when they cost two years' salary. The median home price in 1992 was $100,000. Now it's over $400,000, while wages have barely doubled. The math doesn't work, and everyone who did the math when it worked keeps telling you to try harder.</p><p>Your generation is redefining success because the old definitions are unattainable. It's not owning property—it's finding an apartment you can afford in a city with jobs. It's not retiring at 65—it's hoping to retire at all. It's not building wealth for your children—it's hoping you won't burden them with your care.</p><p>You've watched cryptocurrency boom, crash, boom, and crash again. You've watched housing prices defy gravity. You've watched inflation eat your raises. The rules of financial success keep changing, written by people who already won and revised to ensure you can't.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest strength is also its trap: you believe in self-improvement as salvation. You track everything. Sleep scores. Step counts. Screen time. Meditation streaks. You approach personal growth like an engineering problem, optimizing yourself toward a happiness that keeps receding.</p><p>You're so skilled at adapting to dysfunction that you sometimes forget to challenge it. You've normalized precarious employment, unaffordable housing, and healthcare tied to jobs you can lose at any moment. You've learned to survive broken systems instead of demanding they be fixed.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that cost you. You've been trained to be collaborative, agreeable, and professional—which often means accepting less than you deserve. You'll take 'exposure' instead of payment. You'll absorb extra work without extra compensation. You'll stay in bad situations because leaving feels worse.</p><p>You're so steeped in irony that earnestness feels risky. You can't just care about something—you have to care about it ironically, or care while acknowledging the absurdity of caring, or care while pre-emptively mocking yourself for caring. This makes advocating for yourself surprisingly difficult.</p><p>Your generation is chronically online in ways that sometimes substitute for offline action. You can organize on social media, but voter turnout in local elections is dismal. You can cancel celebrities, but changing laws requires showing up to boring meetings. The dopamine hit of digital activism feels like progress even when it isn't.</p><p>You've been told you're special so many times that ordinary feels like failure. Your parents said you could be anything. Childhood participation trophies told you everyone wins. Reality told you something different, and the gap between expectation and outcome fuels a lot of your anxiety.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (2012-2022):</strong> You graduated into an economy still recovering from 2008. You took jobs beneath your qualifications. You lived with roommates or parents longer than you planned. You watched rent consume more of your income every year. This was supposed to be your decade of exploration and growth. Instead, it was about survival and adaptation. You ended it in a pandemic, which felt about right.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2022-2032):</strong> You're in this decade now. You're probably earning more than your twenties but still not enough. You're watching Gen Z enter the workforce with different expectations and older generations finally retire with resources you'll never accumulate. This is supposedly your 'settling down' period, but settling requires stability you don't have. You're building a life on foundations that keep shifting. If you want kids, the biological and financial clocks are both ticking.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2032-2042):</strong> Statistically, this will be your peak earning decade. You'll have more authority, more clarity, more acceptance of what you can't change. Your parents will be elderly, bringing new responsibilities. You might be managing aging parents, children, and career demands simultaneously—the sandwich generation in full effect. This is when you either double down on what you've built or burn it down and start fresh. Most people do a little of both.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2042-2052):</strong> By now, you'll have survived multiple economic crises, at least one pandemic, and countless 'unprecedented' events that happen every few years. You'll be close to traditional retirement age but unlikely to retire traditionally. You'll mentor younger colleagues who don't understand why you're so cautious, so scarred, so obsessed with emergency funds. You'll be annoyed at their optimism and jealous of it simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2052+):</strong> Retirement, if it happens, will look nothing like your parents' version. Part-time work, gig economy participation, or reliance on family are all likely. Social Security's future is uncertain. Climate change will have reshaped geography and economics. The world will be unrecognizable from the one you were born into. You'll tell younger people about landlines, Blockbuster, and life before smartphones. They'll think you're exaggerating. You won't be.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.1 million people born in 1992. The Millennial generation totals about 72 million Americans, the largest generation until Gen Z overtakes it sometime this decade.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more educated, more diverse, and significantly less wealthy at the same age. Gen X inherited a functioning economy and watched it break. They got affordable college—you got student loans. They got pensions—you got 401(k)s with fees that eat your gains. They got starter homes—you got starter apartments you can barely afford.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the wealth gap is staggering. Boomers controlled about 21% of American wealth when they were your age. Millennials control roughly 7%. Boomers bought houses for two or three years' salary. You're spending that on rent. Boomers expected pensions and Social Security. You expect neither.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're similar but slightly more bruised. You remember when things felt possible. Gen Z doesn't have that baseline. You believed the system could work if fixed. Gen Z assumes it's broken beyond repair and builds workarounds. You adapted to smartphones arriving. They don't remember before. You're the last generation with memories of the before times.</p><p>Your projected lifespan is 78-82 years, slightly lower than previous generations due to rising rates of deaths from suicide, overdose, and alcohol—the 'deaths of despair' that economists track as a marker of how your generation is doing. Spoiler: not great.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more educated, and more aware of systemic problems than any generation before. You've normalized mental health treatment. You've pushed for workplace equity. You've demanded that institutions acknowledge problems they used to ignore. The world you're creating is more inclusive, more aware, and more honest about its failures. That's worth something, even if it doesn't pay the rent.</p>"
