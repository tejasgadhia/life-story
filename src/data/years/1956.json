      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1956-1968</h2><p>The smell of Crayola crayons warming on a sunny windowsill. The satisfying snap of Lincoln Logs clicking into place. The weight of a View-Master pressed against your face, clicking through reels of the Grand Canyon and Disneyland while the plastic eyepiece left red rings around your eyes. Your childhood had a texture that children today will never know—everything was tactile, mechanical, present.</p><p>At three, you were watching Howdy Doody and Captain Kangaroo, Captain Kangaroo with his big pockets full of surprises and Mr. Green Jeans who always seemed to have an animal to show. By five, you'd graduated to The Mickey Mouse Club, memorizing the theme song and deciding whether you liked Annette or Cubby better. You probably had a coonskin cap from the Davy Crockett craze that swept the nation before you fully understood who Davy Crockett was.</p><p>Your toy box was a museum of 1950s engineering. Slinkys that walked down stairs (when they weren't getting tangled). Silly Putty you'd press onto the Sunday comics to lift images of Dick Tracy and Blondie. Mr. Potato Head—the original kind, where you stuck plastic parts into actual potatoes from the kitchen. Etch A Sketch, with those maddening knobs that could only draw straight lines. Erector Sets with actual metal pieces and real screws.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred. You'd wake before your parents, pour yourself a bowl of Sugar Frosted Flakes (Tony the Tiger was new), and plant yourself in front of the RCA. Mighty Mouse. Huckleberry Hound. Quick Draw McGraw. The picture was black and white, the reception was fuzzy, and you didn't care because it was yours—those two hours of cartoons before anyone made you go outside.</p><p>You ate TV dinners on metal trays, watching the news with your parents before being sent to bed. You drank Kool-Aid and Tang, the drink of astronauts. You begged for Fritos and Jiffy Pop, that aluminum pan you'd shake over the burner while the foil dome expanded like magic. The Good Humor truck came down your street, and you learned to listen for that bell like your life depended on it.</p><p>At seven, the world cracked. Adults cried in ways you'd never seen. The television stayed on for days. You didn't understand death yet, not really, but you understood that the grownups were broken, and that broke something in you too. Dallas changed everything, even if you couldn't name what changed.</p>"

    "generational_identity": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The name stuck because of what your parents did right after World War II—made babies. Lots of them. Your generation is 76 million Americans, the demographic tidal wave that reshaped every institution it touched: schools, jobs, housing, politics. You didn't just live through history; your sheer numbers bent history around you.</p><p>You were seven years old when President Kennedy was shot in Dallas. Second grade. Someone came to the classroom door, spoke quietly to your teacher, and then the teacher started crying. They sent you home. Your parents were glued to the television for days—the funeral, the riderless horse, little John-John saluting. The optimism of Camelot died in that motorcade, and something in your childhood died with it. This is your generation's defining rupture, the moment that split the American century in two.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964—but you're right in the middle, in that crucial spot where you're old enough to remember the innocence of the early '60s and young enough to feel the chaos of the late '60s. You straddled the line between Leave It to Beaver and Easy Rider, between Pat Boone and Janis Joplin.</p><p>The assassinations kept coming. You were twelve when Martin Luther King Jr. was shot at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy in a Los Angeles kitchen. You were learning, without anyone teaching you explicitly, that hoping for things was dangerous, that leaders could be taken, that the future was not guaranteed.</p><p>You're blamed for everything now—housing prices, climate change, the deficit. The 'OK Boomer' dismissal stings, not because it's entirely unfair, but because it flattens you into a caricature. You were hippies and soldiers, protesters and police, idealists and pragmatists. You contained multitudes. You still do.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Elvis Presley had just exploded onto the scene like a grenade tossed into America's living room. The year you were born, 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'Hound Dog' blasted from every jukebox and transistor radio. Parents were horrified. Ed Sullivan filmed him from the waist up. Teenagers screamed. Rock and roll had arrived, and nothing would be the same.</p><p>You were four when The Flintstones premiered—prime time animation with jokes for adults that sailed over your head. You were six when The Jetsons promised a future of flying cars and robot maids. The contrast wasn't lost on anyone: cavemen and space age, both brought to you by Hanna-Barbera.</p><p>At eight, the Beatles landed at JFK Airport. You were in third grade when 73 million people watched them on Ed Sullivan—the largest television audience in history. You probably didn't scream like your older sister did, but you learned all the words to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' anyway. The British Invasion had begun, and your transistor radio became your lifeline.</p><p>The movies of your childhood were epics. You were seven when Lawrence of Arabia swept the Oscars—three hours and forty-five minutes of desert and David Lean's camera. Eight when Cleopatra nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox. Nine when Mary Poppins made Julie Andrews a star and 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' entered the language permanently.</p><p>By high school, the culture had fractured. You were thirteen when Bonnie and Clyde made violence stylish and The Graduate made adultery complicated. Fourteen when 2001: A Space Odyssey confused everyone and Hair put nudity on Broadway. Fifteen when Easy Rider suggested the American Dream was a lie and Woodstock suggested half a million people could gather peacefully in a muddy field.</p><p>Your soundtrack shifted from bubblegum to something darker. The Beach Boys' 'Good Vibrations' to the Doors' 'The End.' The Monkees to Hendrix at Monterey. Herman's Hermits to the Rolling Stones at Altamont. Pop music grew up alongside you, and by the time you graduated high school, innocence was a memory.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The hum of a window air conditioner on a summer night. The click-whir of a rotary phone as you dialed your best friend's number from memory. The satisfying thunk of changing channels on the television set with the dial that actually turned. Your childhood had sounds that no longer exist.</p><p>At five, your family probably got their first color television—a massive wooden console that took up half the living room and required five minutes to 'warm up' before the picture appeared. Bonanza in color. Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color actually making sense of its name. The test pattern with the Indian chief that meant programming was over for the night.</p><p>You were thirteen when humans walked on the moon. July 20, 1969. You watched it on television—the fuzzy images, Armstrong's voice crackling from 240,000 miles away, 'That's one small step for man...' Your parents' generation had survived the Depression and won World War II. Yours had just put men on the moon. The future seemed limitless.</p><p>The technology of your adolescence was transitional. Eight-track tapes that would unspool at the worst moment. Cassettes that you could record off the radio if you timed the pause button right. Polaroid cameras that spit out photos you had to shake (even though shaking did nothing). The pocket calculator, which seemed like magic until it became mundane.</p><p>You were twenty-one when the Apple II launched—a computer you could actually own, though you probably didn't because it cost $1,298 and what would you do with it? You were twenty-five when the IBM PC arrived, and suddenly offices changed forever. You learned to type on actual typewriters, then had to relearn on keyboards. White-out became obsolete. The delete key became your friend.</p><p>You've bridged every technological era since. Vinyl to cassettes to CDs to MP3s to streaming. Landlines to car phones to cell phones to smartphones. Broadcast TV to cable to TiVo to Netflix. You've adapted to more technological change than any previous generation, and you did it as an adult, which is harder than growing up with it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the Suez Crisis, when the old empires of Britain and France tried to flex muscles they no longer had. Egypt nationalized the canal. Britain, France, and Israel invaded. America and the Soviet Union—on the same side for once—told them to stop. The old world was dying. The new world was being born. You arrived right at the seam.</p><p>At six, you experienced the Cuban Missile Crisis. October 1962. Your parents were scared in a way you'd never seen—checking the sky for planes, talking about bomb shelters, wondering if there would be a tomorrow. For thirteen days, the world hung on the edge of nuclear war. You were too young to understand the politics, old enough to absorb the fear.</p><p>At seven, Dallas. The rupture that defines your generation happened while you were in second grade. The details live in your Generational Identity—here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape your entire understanding of American power.</p><p>Vietnam was the war of your adolescence. You were thirteen when the Tet Offensive proved the government had been lying about progress. Seventeen during Kent State, when National Guardsmen shot college students on an American campus. Eighteen when your draft lottery number determined whether you'd go or stay. The war touched everyone—brothers, cousins, boyfriends, classmates. Fifty-eight thousand names on a wall, and you know some of them.</p><p>At eighteen, you watched Nixon resign—the first president to do so. The Watergate hearings had been background noise for two years, and then suddenly it was over. 'I am not a crook' became a punchline. Trust in government, already wounded by Vietnam, collapsed entirely. You've never fully trusted institutions since.</p><p>At thirty-three, you watched the Berlin Wall fall, chunks of concrete becoming souvenirs. At forty-five, you watched the towers fall, smoke rising over Manhattan. At sixty-four, you watched a pandemic shut down the world. History keeps happening, and you keep watching.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Here's the truth about timing: you entered the workforce in the mid-1970s, during stagflation, gas lines, and a recession that made your parents' stories about the Depression feel less distant. The postwar boom your older siblings caught? You missed it. The job market you entered was brutal—double-digit inflation, unemployment over 8%, and a general sense that America's best days were behind it.</p><p>But the economy recovered, and you recovered with it. By your late twenties, the Reagan boom was in full swing. Morning in America. Deregulation. The stock market soaring. If you'd positioned yourself in finance, real estate, or the emerging tech sector, the 1980s minted you. If you'd stayed in manufacturing, you watched your industry begin its long decline. The divergence in your generation's fortunes started here.</p><p>Your generation invented the modern two-income household—not as liberation alone, but as economic necessity. When you were a kid, one salary bought a house, a car, vacations. By the time you were raising kids, two salaries barely covered what one used to. Women entered the workforce in record numbers, which was progress, but also meant the economy now required two earners for what one provided before. The ratchet tightened.</p><p>The company man died on your watch. You started your career when the implicit contract still held: loyalty for security, decades of service for a pension and a gold watch. By the time you hit middle management, downsizing had entered the vocabulary. Layoffs weren't failures; they were 'right-sizing.' The pension fund got raided. The 401(k) became your retirement, which meant the stock market became your anxiety.</p><p>You've worked for companies that no longer exist—absorbed, bankrupt, disrupted. You've survived mergers where half your colleagues disappeared. You've trained your replacements, sometimes younger workers who cost less, sometimes software that cost nothing. The workplace of your twenties—secretarial pools, carbon copies, long liquid lunches—is as extinct as the dinosaurs. You adapted. You always adapted.</p><p>If you're still working, you're probably a consultant now, or part-time, or doing something that lets you use decades of expertise while someone younger handles the technology. If you've retired, you probably didn't do it at 65—you did it when the math worked or when your body decided for you. The retirement your parents expected doesn't exist anymore, if it ever did.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when meeting someone meant actually meeting them? At a dance, a party, through friends, at church. You'd spot them across the room. Work up the courage to approach. Ask for their number, which meant their parents' number, which meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer.</p><p>Dating in your era required commitment before it even started. Asking someone out meant facing potential rejection in person. Going steady meant something. Breaking up meant awkward encounters at school because you couldn't just unfollow them. Relationships had weight because extracting yourself from one took actual effort.</p><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, when the Pill changed everything and suddenly the rules your parents lived by seemed optional. Free love, women's liberation, the Summer of Love. The theory was liberating. The practice was more complicated. Some of you embraced the revolution. Some of you watched from the sidelines. Most of you ended up somewhere in between, freer than your parents but more confused than anyone admitted.</p><p>The divorce rate doubled during your prime marrying years. You were eighteen in 1974, when divorce hit its stride. By 1980, half of marriages ended in dissolution. Your generation normalized divorce as an option rather than a scandal. Some of you are on your second or third marriage. Some stayed in unhappy first marriages because leaving seemed worse. Some found lifelong partners on the first try. There was no single Boomer experience—just millions of individual experiments in love and commitment.</p><p>Your friendships have endured decades through letters, then phone calls, then email, now text and FaceTime. You've kept in touch with people you met in college, in your first jobs, in neighborhoods you've long since left. Friendships used to require more effort, which may be why yours have lasted. Or maybe you just grew up in an era when people stayed put longer, put down roots deeper, maintained connections that took work.</p><p>You're watching your grandchildren date through apps, breaking up via text, maintaining relationships with people they've never met in person. It looks alien to you. But then again, your parents thought long-distance phone calls were extravagant, and you spent hours on them anyway. Every generation finds its way.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial psychology was shaped by specific traumas. You remember the gas lines of 1973, wrapping around the block, odd/even rationing days. You remember inflation hitting 13.5% in 1980, watching your money lose value month by month. You remember Black Monday in 1987, when the market dropped 22% in a single day. These scars taught you that money is never safe, that markets crash, that vigilance is required.</p><p>But the averages hide enormous variation, and you know it. Some in your generation are millionaires several times over. Some are bankrupt. Some retired at 55 to golf courses and cruises. Some are working at Walmart at 70 because Social Security doesn't cover rent. The divergence in your generation's finances is wider than the canyon you once saw through a View-Master reel.</p><p>The house you bought in 1985 for $80,000 is worth $400,000 now, maybe more. That's a 2.5x income purchase that became a 6x income asset while you slept. You didn't do anything to earn that appreciation—you just lived in the house. The math of housing shifted beneath you, lifting you higher without effort.</p><p>You've been lectured about spending by your parents (the Depression generation, who saved compulsively and reused aluminum foil) and lectured about hoarding by your kids (who face a housing market unrecognizable from yours). You're caught in the middle, blamed for prices you didn't set, wealth you accumulated by accident of timing.</p><p>Your biggest financial anxiety now isn't accumulation—it's preservation. How long will you live? Will the money last? What will healthcare cost? What will you leave your kids, and will it help them or just delay their own financial reckoning? You planned for retirement at 65, but you might live to 95. Nobody told you to plan for thirty years of not working.</p><p>Credit cards arrived when you were in your twenties—the idea of buying now and paying later was novel. Your parents would have been horrified. You adapted, using credit strategically while their voices echoed in your head about living within your means. The 401(k) replaced the pension during your career—all the risk transferred to you, all the responsibility for investing correctly, all the anxiety about whether your spreadsheets were right.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's most painful blind spot is the belief that the economy you navigated still exists. When you say 'I worked my way through college,' you're remembering tuition of $500 per semester and summer jobs that covered it. Today's students face $50,000 per year and summer jobs that cover books, maybe. The advice is technically the same. The math is impossible.</p><p>You sometimes confuse survival bias with universal truth. 'I started with nothing and built my career'—but you started when entry-level jobs paid living wages, when companies trained employees instead of requiring experience for entry-level positions, when showing up reliably was enough to advance. Your success was real. The conditions that enabled it have vanished.</p><p>You're uncomfortable with systemic explanations because they complicate the meritocracy narrative. If hard work always pays off, then people who haven't succeeded must not be working hard. This logic breaks down under data—wages decoupled from productivity in 1973, housing costs outpaced incomes, education costs exploded—but abandoning it means questioning everything you believe about your own achievements.</p><p>Your generation protested inequality in the '60s, then entrenched it in the '80s. You marched for civil rights, then moved to suburbs with exclusionary zoning. You championed environmentalism, then opposed the regulations that would address it. The tension between your youthful ideals and your middle-aged choices is real, and it's awkward, and younger generations notice even when they lack the full context.</p><p>Perhaps the deepest blind spot: you don't realize how much the world has changed because you changed with it, gradually, one adaptation at a time. The young people struggling now aren't facing your economy with different attitudes. They're facing a different economy entirely. Seeing that clearly requires more than adjusting for inflation. It requires imagining a world where the rules you followed no longer apply.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1976-1986):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation, gas shortages, and a national malaise that Jimmy Carter named and Ronald Reagan promised to cure. Jobs were scarce. Inflation ate your paychecks. The postwar boom your older siblings caught had ended. But you adapted—you always adapted. By the early '80s, the economy recovered, and you recovered with it. You got your first real job. Maybe got married. Maybe had kids. The life script your parents followed still seemed plausible, even if the edges were fraying.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1986-1996):</strong> Your prime building years. Career advancement, family obligations, the grind of mortgages and daycare costs and trying to do everything at once. The economy boomed, busted in '87, then boomed again. The Cold War ended—you watched the Berlin Wall fall on television, champagne and sledgehammers, the vindication of everything your childhood duck-and-cover drills had prepared you for. History declared itself over. You were too busy raising kids and climbing ladders to fully process what that meant.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1996-2006):</strong> Peak earning years. You had authority at work, equity in your home, kids who were becoming teenagers (which brought its own challenges). The dot-com boom made you feel wealthy; the bust reminded you that markets crash. September 11, 2001 changed the national mood—security became anxiety, travel became hassle, forever wars began. But you were established enough to weather turbulence. Your foundation was solid. You could absorb the shocks.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2006-2016):</strong> The 2008 financial crisis hit when you were fifty-two. Your 401(k) dropped 40%. If you'd planned to retire early, those plans vaporized. But you had time—a decade or more of working years to recover what was lost. Your kids graduated into the worst job market since the Depression. You watched them struggle and wondered what you could have done differently. The sandwich generation years arrived: aging parents needing care, adult children needing support, you in the middle managing everyone's crisis.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2016-2026):</strong> You're here now, or finishing this decade. Retirement, if you've achieved it, looks different than your parents' retirement—more active, more connected, more uncertain about how long the money needs to last. A pandemic shut down the world when you were sixty-four, and suddenly your health felt more fragile, your mortality more real. Your grandchildren are growing up in a world you barely recognize, with technology you're still learning and problems you didn't cause but are blamed for anyway.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2026+):</strong> You're likely to live into your eighties, maybe nineties—longer than any previous generation. Medical advances, better nutrition, decades of relative prosperity have extended your lifespan beyond anything your grandparents imagined. The question isn't how long you'll live; it's how well. Healthcare costs, cognitive decline, the slow accumulation of losses—friends, siblings, the world you knew. You'll be the keeper of stories about a time before smartphones, before the internet, before everything accelerated beyond recognition. Tell those stories. Someone needs to remember.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>4.2 million people were born in the US the same year as you. Your sheer numbers warped every institution you touched: classrooms that couldn't hold you, job markets that couldn't absorb you, housing markets that inflated when you bought and will deflate when you sell.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> Your parents and older siblings. They survived the Depression, fought World War II, built the suburbs you grew up in. They valued conformity, stability, keeping your head down and working hard. You valued self-expression, questioned authority, and grew your hair long just to watch them wince. They think you were spoiled by prosperity. You think they were repressed by scarcity. Both are probably right.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The overlooked generation that came right after you. They grew up in your shadow, the forgotten middle children between Boomer cultural dominance and Millennial digital natives. They watched you get the jobs, the houses, the promotions, the attention. They developed a sardonic, self-reliant edge as a survival mechanism. They're still waiting for you to retire so they can finally run things. They're patient. They've had to be.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> Here's where it gets uncomfortable. Your generation controlled 21% of the nation's wealth at their age. They control 7%. You bought houses for two to three years' salary. They face eight to ten years' salary for the same purchase. You had pensions. They have gig economy jobs and crushing student debt for degrees you told them were mandatory. The 'OK Boomer' dismissal isn't fair—it flattens millions of individual lives into a generational caricature—but the underlying frustration is mathematically justified.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Your grandchildren's generation, or close to it. They don't remember a world before smartphones, social media, or school shooting drills. They've never known economic security or assumed the future would be better than the present. They look at your generation's wealth and stability with something between confusion and resentment. You look at their nihilism and digital fluency with something between concern and incomprehension. You're from different planets, connected by DNA.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've already beaten that, many of you significantly. You're the longest-lived generation in American history, which creates complications nobody planned for: retirement savings that need to last thirty years, healthcare costs that compound, cognitive decline that demands care.</p><p>But you've also lived through more transformation than any generation before you. You went from three TV channels to unlimited streaming. From party lines to smartphones. From segregation to a Black president. From the moon landing to Mars rovers. You've adapted to more change than seemed humanly possible. That adaptability is your gift to the generations that follow, whether they recognize it or not.</p>"
