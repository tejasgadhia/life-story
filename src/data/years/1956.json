      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1956-1968</h2><p>Children born in 1956 grew up in the last years of a particular kind of American certainty. The Eisenhower era was winding down, but its domestic rhythms persisted — the predictable weekday routines, the Saturday errands, the Sunday church. Their neighborhoods were established now, the trees tall enough for climbing, the sidewalks cracked enough to skip rope over. These were not the children of new developments and freshly poured foundations. They inherited a suburbia that had settled into something approaching permanence, and they took its comforts for granted because they had never known anything else.</p><p>The family structure remained remarkably consistent. Fathers worked and returned. Mothers managed the domestic sphere with a competence that the culture both relied upon and refused to properly value. Children were expected to be respectful, to eat what was served, to handle their own social conflicts, and to stay out of serious trouble. Emotional openness was not encouraged. When children were hurt or frightened, the standard response was to toughen up, shake it off, get back out there. The stoicism was not cruelty — it was simply the operating philosophy of a generation of parents who had survived depression and war and believed, not unreasonably, that resilience was the most important gift they could give their children.</p><p>At six, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the Cold War into their homes with unprecedented immediacy. For thirteen days in October 1962, nuclear war seemed genuinely possible, and children sensed the fear in their parents — a fear different from the managed anxiety of duck-and-cover drills, rawer and less contained. The crisis passed, but the lesson stayed: the world was more dangerous than the calm surface of suburban life suggested, and the adults who ran it were not as confident as they appeared.</p><p>At seven, the president was assassinated. These children were in second grade, old enough to feel the shock but too young to fully comprehend it. What they understood was that the adults around them were devastated — teachers weeping, parents glued to the television, the normal routines of life suspended for days. The event didn't just end a presidency; for these children, it ended a kind of innocence about the reliability of the world. Before Dallas, things worked. After Dallas, the working of things required a kind of faith that hadn't been necessary before.</p><p>The remaining years of their childhood — ages eight through twelve — coincided with the most turbulent period in modern American history. The civil rights movement intensified, the Vietnam War escalated, and the cultural consensus that had defined their early years fractured along lines of race, politics, and generation. At twelve, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated within two months of each other, and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago devolved into a nationally televised confrontation between protesters and police. These children entered their teenage years carrying the full weight of that turmoil, having watched the America of their early childhood transform into something their parents could not explain and could barely recognize.</p><p>The defining quality of this cohort's childhood is the speed of the transformation they witnessed. They began in a world of orderly classrooms and confident adults and finished in one of assassinations and riots and a war that nobody could justify. The distance between those two points — separated by barely a decade — gave this cohort an early education in the impermanence of social order. They learned, before they were old enough to drive, that the world could change faster than anyone expected, and that the change was not always for the better.</p>"

The name comes from the post-WWII birth spike that produced roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans, the demographic tidal wave that reshaped every institution it touched: schools, jobs, housing, politics. They didn't just live through history; their sheer numbers bent history around them.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">This cohort was seven years old when President Kennedy was shot in Dallas. Second grade.</span> Someone came to the classroom door, spoke quietly to the teacher, and then the teacher started crying. They sent the children home. Parents were glued to the television for days\u2014the funeral, the riderless horse, little John-John saluting. The optimism of Camelot died in that motorcade, and something in their childhood died with it. This is this generation's defining rupture, the moment that split the American century in two.</p><p>This generation spans 1946 to 1964\u2014but those born in 1956 are right in the middle, in that crucial spot where they're old enough to remember the innocence of the early '60s and young enough to feel the chaos of the late '60s. They straddled the line between Leave It to Beaver and Easy Rider, between Pat Boone and Janis Joplin.</p><p>The assassinations kept coming. This cohort was twelve when Martin Luther King Jr. was shot at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy in a Los Angeles kitchen. They were learning, without anyone teaching them explicitly, that hoping for things was dangerous, that leaders could be taken, that the future was not guaranteed.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">This generation is blamed for everything now\u2014housing prices, climate change, the deficit.</span> The 'OK Boomer' dismissal stings, not because it's entirely unfair, but because it flattens millions into a caricature. They were hippies and soldiers, protesters and police, idealists and pragmatists. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> They contained multitudes.

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Elvis Presley had just exploded onto the scene like a grenade tossed into America's living room. The year 1956, 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'Hound Dog' blasted from every jukebox and transistor radio. Parents were horrified. Ed Sullivan filmed him from the waist up. Teenagers screamed. Rock and roll had arrived, and nothing would be the same.</p><p>At four, The Flintstones premiered\u2014prime time animation with jokes for adults that sailed over children's heads. At six, The Jetsons promised a future of flying cars and robot maids. The contrast wasn't lost on anyone: cavemen and space age, both brought by Hanna-Barbera.</p><p>At eight, the Beatles landed at JFK Airport. In third grade, 73 million people watched them on Ed Sullivan\u2014the largest television audience in history. Children probably didn't scream like their older sisters did, but they learned all the words to 'I Want to Hold Their Hand' anyway. The British Invasion had begun, and the transistor radio became a lifeline.</p><p>The movies of this childhood era were epics. At seven, Lawrence of Arabia swept the Oscars\u2014three hours and forty-five minutes of desert and David Lean's camera. Eight when Cleopatra nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox. Nine when Mary Poppins made Julie Andrews a star and 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' entered the language permanently.</p><p>By high school, the culture had fractured. At thirteen, Bonnie and Clyde made violence stylish and The Graduate made adultery complicated. Fourteen when 2001: A Space Odyssey confused everyone and Hair put nudity on Broadway. Fifteen when Easy Rider suggested the American Dream was a lie and Woodstock suggested half a million people could gather peacefully in a muddy field.</p><p>The soundtrack shifted from bubblegum to something darker. The Beach Boys' 'Good Vibrations' to the Doors' 'The End.' The Monkees to Hendrix at Monterey. Herman's Hermits to the Rolling Stones at Altamont. Pop music grew up alongside this generation, and by the time they graduated high school, innocence was a memory.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The technological landscape of childhood included sounds that no longer exist. The hum of a window air conditioner on a summer night. The click-whir of a rotary phone as someone dialed a best friend's number from memory. The satisfying thunk of changing channels on the television set with the dial that actually turned.</p><p>At five, families probably got their first color television\u2014a massive wooden console that took up half the living room and required five minutes to 'warm up' before the picture appeared. Bonanza in color. Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color actually making sense of its name. The test pattern with the Indian chief that meant programming was over for the night.</p><p>At thirteen, humans walked on the moon. July 20, 1969. The fuzzy images, Armstrong's voice crackling from 240,000 miles away, 'That's one small step for man...' The parents' generation had survived the Depression and won World War II. This generation had just put men on the moon. The future seemed limitless.</p><p>The technology of adolescence was transitional. Eight-track tapes that would unspool at the worst moment. Cassettes that could be recorded off the radio if someone timed the pause button right. Polaroid cameras that spit out photos that had to be shaken (even though shaking did nothing). The pocket calculator, which seemed like magic until it became mundane.</p><p>At twenty-one, the Apple II launched\u2014a computer someone could actually own, though most didn't because it cost $1,298 and what would they do with it? At twenty-five, the IBM PC arrived, and suddenly offices changed forever. People learned to type on actual typewriters, then had to relearn on keyboards. White-out became obsolete. The delete key became a friend.</p><p>This generation bridged every technological era since. Vinyl to cassettes to CDs to MP3s to streaming. Landlines to car phones to cell phones to smartphones. Broadcast TV to cable to TiVo to Netflix. They adapted to more technological change than any previous generation, and they did it as adults, which is harder than growing up with it.</p>"

The new world was being born. this generation arrived right at the seam.</p><p>At six, the Cuban Missile Crisis. October 1962. Parents were scared in a way children had never seen\u2014checking the sky for planes, talking about bomb shelters, wondering if there would be a tomorrow. For thirteen days, the world hung on the edge of nuclear war. Children were too young to understand the politics, old enough to absorb the fear.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At seven, Dallas. November 22, 1963.</span> The rupture that defines this generation happened while they were in second grade. The details live in the Generational Identity section\u2014here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape their entire understanding of American power.</p><p>Vietnam was the war of their adolescence. At thirteen, the Tet Offensive proved the government had been lying about progress. Seventeen during Kent State, when National Guardsmen shot college students on an American campus. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Eighteen when draft lottery numbers determined whether someone would go or stay.</span> The war touched everyone\u2014brothers, cousins, boyfriends, classmates. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,000</span> names on a wall, and this generation knows some of them.</p><p>At eighteen, Nixon resigned\u2014the first president to do so. The Watergate hearings had been background noise for two years, and then suddenly it was over. 'I am not a crook' became a punchline. Trust in government, already wounded by Vietnam, collapsed entirely. This generation has never fully trusted institutions since.</p><p>At thirty-three, the Berlin Wall fell, chunks of concrete becoming souvenirs. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At sixty-four, a pandemic shut down the world.

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The job market of 1978 offered a challenging entry point. Stagflation, gas lines, and a recession made Depression stories feel less distant. The postwar boom that older siblings caught had ended. The job market was difficult\u2014double-digit inflation, unemployment over 8%, and a general sense that America's best days were behind it.</p><p>But the economy recovered. By the late twenties for this generation, the Reagan boom was in full swing. Morning in America. Deregulation. The stock market soaring. Those who positioned themselves in finance, real estate, or the emerging tech sector found the 1980s lucrative. Those who stayed in manufacturing watched their industry begin its long decline. The divergence in this generation's fortunes started here.</p><p>This generation invented the modern two-income household\u2014not as liberation alone, but as economic necessity. When they were kids, one salary bought a house, a car, vacations. By the time they were raising kids, two salaries barely covered what one used to. Women entered the workforce in record numbers, which was progress, but also meant the economy now required two earners for what one provided before.</p><p>The company man died on this generation's watch. They started careers when the implicit contract still held: loyalty for security, decades of service for a pension and a gold watch. By the time they hit middle management, downsizing had entered the vocabulary. Layoffs weren't failures; they were 'right-sizing.' The pension fund got raided. The 401(k) became retirement, which meant the stock market became anxiety.</p><p>This generation worked for companies that no longer exist\u2014absorbed, bankrupt, disrupted. They survived mergers where half their colleagues disappeared. They trained replacements, sometimes younger workers who cost less, sometimes software that cost nothing. The workplace of their twenties\u2014secretarial pools, carbon copies, long liquid lunches\u2014is as extinct as the dinosaurs. They adapted. They always adapted.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit\u2014and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> Those still working are probably consultants now, or part-time, or doing something that lets them use decades of expertise while someone younger handles the technology. Those who've retired probably didn't do it at 65\u2014they did it when the math worked or when their body decided for them.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>The generation that came of age when meeting someone meant actually meeting them. At a dance, a party, through friends, at church. Spotting someone across the room. Working up the courage to approach. Asking for their number, which meant their parents' number, which meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer.</p><p>Dating in this era required commitment before it even started. Asking someone out meant facing potential rejection in person. Going steady meant something. Breaking up meant awkward encounters at school because they couldn't just unfollow them. Relationships had weight because extracting oneself from one took actual effort.</p><p>This cohort came of age during the sexual revolution, when the Pill changed everything and suddenly the rules their parents lived by seemed optional. Free love, women's liberation, the Summer of Love. The theory was liberating. The practice was more complicated. Some embraced the revolution. Some watched from the sidelines. Most ended up somewhere in between, freer than their parents but more confused than anyone admitted.</p><p>The divorce rate doubled during their prime marrying years. At eighteen in 1974, when divorce hit its stride. By 1980, half of marriages ended in dissolution. This generation normalized divorce as an option rather than a scandal. Some are on their second or third marriage. Some stayed in unhappy first marriages because leaving seemed worse. Some found lifelong partners on the first try. There was no single Boomer experience\u2014just millions of individual experiments in love and commitment.</p><p>Friendships have endured decades through letters, then phone calls, then email, now text and FaceTime. They've kept in touch with people met in college, in first jobs, in neighborhoods long since left. Friendships used to require more effort, which may be why theirs have lasted. Or maybe they just grew up in an era when people stayed put longer, put down roots deeper, maintained connections that took work.</p><p>This generation watches grandchildren date through apps, breaking up via text, maintaining relationships with people they've never met in person. It looks alien. But then again, their parents thought long-distance phone calls were extravagant, and they spent hours on them anyway. Every generation finds its way.</p>"

The gas lines of 1973, wrapping around the block, odd/even rationing days. Inflation hitting <span class=\"stat-box\">13.5%</span> in 1980, watching money lose value month by month. Black Monday in 1987, when the market dropped <span class=\"stat-box\">22%</span> in a single day. <span class=\"pull-quote\">These scars taught this generation that money is never safe, that markets crash, that vigilance is required.</span></p><p>But the averages hide enormous variation. Some in this generation are millionaires several times over. Some are bankrupt. Some retired at 55 to golf courses and cruises. Some are working at Walmart at 70 because Social Security doesn't cover rent. The divergence in this generation's finances is wider than the canyon they once saw through a View-Master reel.</p><p>The house bought in 1985 for <span class=\"stat-box\">$80,000</span> is worth <span class=\"stat-box\">$400,000</span> now, maybe more. <span class=\"hero-callout\">That's a 2.5x income purchase that became a 6x income asset while they slept. They didn't do anything to earn that appreciation\u2014they just lived in the house.</span> The math of housing shifted beneath them, lifting them higher without effort.</p><p>This generation has been lectured about spending by their parents (the Depression generation, who saved compulsively and reused aluminum foil) and lectured about hoarding by their kids (who face a housing market unrecognizable from theirs). They're caught in the middle, blamed for prices they didn't set, wealth they accumulated by accident of timing.</p><p>The biggest financial anxiety now isn't accumulation\u2014it's preservation. How long will they live? Will the money last? What will healthcare cost? What will they leave their kids, and will it help them or just delay their own financial reckoning? They planned for retirement at 65, but they might live to 95. Nobody told them to plan for thirty years of not working.</p><p>Credit cards arrived when they were in their twenties\u2014the idea of buying now and paying later was novel. Their parents would have been horrified. They adapted, using credit strategically while their parents' voices echoed in their heads about living within their means. The 401(k) replaced the pension during their career\u2014all the risk transferred to them, all the responsibility for investing correctly, all the anxiety about whether their spreadsheets were right.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's biggest blind spot is the belief that the economy they navigated still exists. When they say 'I worked my way through college,' they're remembering tuition of $500 per semester and summer jobs that covered it. Today's students face $50,000 per year and summer jobs that cover books, maybe. The advice is technically the same. The math is impossible.</p><p>This cohort sometimes confuses survival bias with universal truth. 'I started with nothing and built my career'\u2014but they started when entry-level jobs paid living wages, when companies trained employees instead of requiring experience for entry-level positions, when showing up reliably was enough to advance. Their success was real. The conditions that enabled it have vanished.</p><p>This generation is uncomfortable with systemic explanations because they complicate the meritocracy narrative. If hard work always pays off, then people who haven't succeeded must not be working hard. This logic breaks down under data\u2014wages decoupled from productivity in 1973, housing costs outpaced incomes, education costs exploded\u2014but abandoning it means questioning everything they believe about their own achievements.</p><p>This generation protested inequality in the '60s, then entrenched it in the '80s. They marched for civil rights, then moved to suburbs with exclusionary zoning. They championed environmentalism, then opposed the regulations that would address it. The tension between their youthful ideals and their middle-aged choices is real, and it's awkward, and younger generations notice even when they lack the full context.</p><p>Perhaps the deepest blind spot: this cohort doesn't realize how much the world has changed because they changed with it, gradually, one adaptation at a time. The young people struggling now aren't facing their economy with different attitudes. They're facing a different economy entirely. Seeing that clearly requires more than adjusting for inflation. It requires imagining a world where the rules they followed no longer apply.</p>"

Jobs were scarce. Inflation ate paychecks. The postwar boom that older siblings caught had ended. But they adapted\u2014they always adapted. By the early '80s, the economy recovered, and they recovered with it. They got their first real job. Maybe got married. Maybe had kids. The life script their parents followed still seemed plausible, even if the edges were fraying.</p><p><strong>30s (1986-1996):</strong> Prime building years. Career advancement, family obligations, the grind of mortgages and daycare costs and trying to do everything at once. The economy boomed, busted in '87, then boomed again. The Cold War ended\u2014they watched the Berlin Wall fall on television, champagne and sledgehammers, the vindication of everything their childhood duck-and-cover drills had prepared them for. History declared itself over. They were too busy raising kids and climbing ladders to fully process what that meant.</p><p><strong>40s (1996-2006):</strong> Peak earning years. They had authority at work, equity in their home, kids who were becoming teenagers (which brought its own challenges). The dot-com boom made them feel wealthy; the bust reminded them that markets crash. September 11, 2001 changed the national mood\u2014security became anxiety, travel became hassle, forever wars began. But they were established enough to weather turbulence. Their foundation was solid. They could absorb the shocks.</p><p><strong>50s (2006-2016):</strong> The 2008 financial crisis hit when they were fifty-two. Their 401(k) dropped 40%. If they'd planned to retire early, those plans vaporized. But they had time\u2014a decade or more of working years to recover what was lost. Their kids graduated into the worst job market since the Depression. They watched them struggle and wondered what they could have done differently. The sandwich generation years arrived: aging parents needing care, adult children needing support, them in the middle managing everyone's crisis.</p><p><strong>60s (2016-2026):</strong> They're here now, or finishing this decade. Retirement, if they've achieved it, looks different than their parents' retirement\u2014more active, more connected, more uncertain about how long the money needs to last. A pandemic shut down the world when they were sixty-four, and suddenly their health felt more fragile, their mortality more real. Their grandchildren are growing up in a world they barely recognize, with technology they're still learning and problems they didn't cause but are blamed for anyway.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2026+):</strong> They're likely to live into their eighties, maybe nineties\u2014longer than any previous generation. Medical advances, better nutrition, decades of relative prosperity have extended their lifespan beyond anything their grandparents imagined. The question isn't how long they'll live; it's how well. Healthcare costs, cognitive decline, the slow accumulation of losses\u2014friends, siblings, the world they knew.

They survived the Depression, fought World War II, built the suburbs this generation grew up in. They valued conformity, stability, keeping heads down and working hard. This generation valued self-expression, questioned authority, and grew their hair long just to watch them wince. The Silent Generation thinks Boomers were spoiled by prosperity. Boomers think the Silent Generation was repressed by scarcity. Both are probably right.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The overlooked generation that came right after. They grew up in Boomer shadow, the forgotten middle children between Boomer cultural dominance and Millennial digital natives. They watched Boomers get the jobs, the houses, the promotions, the attention. They developed a sardonic, self-reliant edge as a survival mechanism.
