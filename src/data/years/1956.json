      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1956-1968</h2><p>You were born the year Elvis Presley hip-thrusted his way into America's living rooms and scandalized a nation that wasn't ready for it. Eisenhower was president, the economy was booming, and the future looked like a place where everyone would own a house, a car, and possibly a personal helicopter. The adults were wrong about the helicopter.</p><p>Your childhood was peak American suburbia. Levittowns multiplied like rabbits. Station wagons filled driveways. Fathers went to work, mothers stayed home, and nobody talked about whether anyone was happy with this arrangement. You played outside until the streetlights came on because there was no internet to keep you indoors and your parents didn't know where you were for hours at a time.</p><p>You were seven when JFK was assassinated. You probably watched the funeral on a black-and-white television while adults cried. You were eight during the Civil Rights Act. Twelve when Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. Twelve when Bobby Kennedy was shot. Your childhood ended somewhere in that sequence of gunshots that kept interrupting the evening news.</p><p>The Cold War was the background radiation of your entire youth. You did duck-and-cover drills at school, hiding under desks as if particle board could stop nuclear annihilation. The Cuban Missile Crisis happened when you were six—close enough to feel the adults' fear, young enough to not fully understand why everyone was so scared.</p><p>Television was your generation's babysitter. Three channels, no remote, no DVR. You watched The Mickey Mouse Club, Leave It to Beaver, and whatever your parents wanted because they controlled the dial. Saturday morning cartoons were sacred. Ed Sullivan on Sunday night was family viewing.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That's 76 million people in the US—the pig-in-the-python demographic bulge that has shaped American culture, politics, and real estate prices for seven decades. Every institution you've passed through has been transformed by the sheer weight of your numbers.</p><p>Your generation was named for the post-war baby boom, when returning soldiers and their sweethearts started making up for lost time. You were raised by the Greatest Generation, people who survived the Depression and won World War II, and who weren't particularly interested in discussing their feelings about any of it.</p><p>The defining tension of your generation is between the early Boomers (born 1946-1954) and the late Boomers (born 1955-1964). You're right on that line—old enough to remember the optimism of the early '60s, young enough to experience the disillusionment of the late '60s and '70s. You straddled the line between idealism and cynicism.</p><p>Your generation went from Woodstock to Wall Street. From 'don't trust anyone over 30' to being over 30 and not understanding why kids don't trust you. You were the counterculture, then you became the culture, then you wondered why the culture felt so hollow. The trajectory from hippie to yuppie happened faster than anyone wants to admit.</p><p>Boomers are simultaneously credited with the civil rights movement, feminism, and environmental awareness, and blamed for income inequality, housing unaffordability, and climate inaction. Both narratives have truth in them. Your generation contained multitudes—and contradictions.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Elvis released 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'Hound Dog,' songs that made parents clutch their pearls and teenagers clutch their hearts. Rock and roll had arrived, and it was loud, sexy, and completely uninterested in adult approval. The Ed Sullivan Show filmed Elvis from the waist up, which only made everyone more curious about what was happening below.</p><p>1956 was also the year Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier of Monaco, giving Americans their first modern celebrity fairy tale. Thirty million people watched the wedding on television. Hollywood's most elegant star became actual royalty. It was the kind of story that made people believe in happy endings, even if happy endings required moving to a tiny European principality.</p><p>Your childhood was soundtracked by the transition from rock and roll to the British Invasion. You were seven when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan. Seventy-three million people watched. Your older siblings probably screamed. You probably thought they were weird. By the time you were twelve, you understood.</p><p>The movies of your youth ranged from Disney (you were four when Sleeping Beauty came out) to films your parents wouldn't let you see. You were twelve when The Graduate showed Dustin Hoffman seduced by Mrs. Robinson, which was scandalous. You were thirteen when Easy Rider suggested the American Dream might be dead. Coming-of-age happened against a backdrop of cultural revolution.</p><p>By high school, you were choosing between the Beatles and the Stones, folk music and psychedelia, protest songs and pop. Music meant something in a way it hadn't before and arguably hasn't since. Albums were statements. Concerts were events. The soundtrack of your youth was the soundtrack of a society coming apart and trying to rebuild itself.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the first transatlantic telephone cable was laid, connecting North America to Europe. Before that, international calls went through unreliable radio signals. Your generation would grow up watching communication technology shrink the world in ways your grandparents couldn't have imagined.</p><p>The technology of your childhood was mechanical, analog, and often required assembly. Erector sets and chemistry sets. Transistor radios you could carry around. Television was a piece of furniture, and the repair man came to your house when it broke because it was too heavy to move.</p><p>You were thirteen when humans walked on the moon. Neil Armstrong's words came through a television speaker, and for one moment, the entire world watched the same thing. You were part of the generation that grew up believing technology could solve any problem, take us anywhere, do anything. Space was the next frontier, and you expected to visit.</p><p>Your twenties brought personal computing, but you were already an adult when it arrived. The Apple II launched when you were 21. IBM's PC came out when you were 25. You learned to use computers as an adult, which is different from growing up with them. You remember the before times, when research meant libraries, math meant calculators (the physical kind), and documents were typed on actual typewriters.</p><p>You've adapted to every major technology shift: from vinyl to cassettes to CDs to streaming. From landlines to cell phones to smartphones. From broadcast TV to cable to Netflix. From letters to email to text messages. You're fluent in every era because you lived through each transition. Younger people don't realize how remarkable that adaptability is.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the Suez Crisis and the Hungarian Revolution, two events that revealed the limits of Cold War power. Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. Britain, France, and Israel invaded. The US and Soviet Union, for once, agreed on something: telling them to stop. Meanwhile, Hungary tried to break free from Soviet control. Soviet tanks rolled in. The world watched and did nothing. These were the first lessons of your generation: superpowers have limits, rebellions get crushed, and nobody's coming to save you.</p><p>You were seven when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. You probably remember where you were, who told you, how the adults reacted. That's the thing about national trauma—it burns itself into memory. The '60s had started so optimistic: Camelot, the New Frontier, the space race. Then came the gunshot, the funeral, the riderless horse, and the sense that something irreplaceable had been lost.</p><p>Vietnam defined your coming-of-age. You turned eighteen in 1974, just as the draft ended, but you grew up watching older boys get sent to a jungle on the other side of the world. You saw the protests, the body counts on the evening news, the growing sense that the government was lying. Trust in institutions started cracking during Vietnam and never fully recovered.</p><p>You were eighteen during Watergate, watching a president resign in disgrace. You were nineteen during the fall of Saigon, watching helicopters evacuate the embassy while people clung to the skids. Your formative years ended with twin images of American failure: a president leaving office in scandal, and a war ending in chaotic retreat.</p><p>You were twenty-five when Reagan was elected, marking the end of the '60s idealism and the start of something harder-edged. You were thirty-three when the Berlin Wall fell. Forty-five during 9/11. Fifty-two during the 2008 financial crisis. Sixty-four when COVID hit. History didn't stop—it accelerated—and you've had a front-row seat to all of it.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the mid-1970s, during stagflation, oil crises, and economic malaise that made the postwar boom feel like ancient history. The economy your parents promised wasn't waiting for you. Jobs were harder to find. Inflation ate your paychecks. The rules had changed, and nobody gave you the updated manual.</p><p>But you adapted, because Boomers adapt. You entered industries that were still hiring: manufacturing, finance, healthcare, education. You climbed ladders that still existed, in companies that still offered pensions and lifetime employment. The deal was: show up, work hard, stay loyal, and the company would take care of you. That deal would expire before you retired, but it held long enough for you to benefit.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the two-income household, partly by choice and partly by necessity. Women entered the professional workforce in unprecedented numbers. Dual incomes became the norm, then became required to maintain the lifestyle that single incomes once provided. You called it liberation. Economists called it a ratchet.</p><p>You were in your thirties during the '80s boom, your peak career-building years. If you were in finance, real estate, or tech, you made money. If you were in manufacturing, you watched your industry start its long decline. The divergence between winners and losers in your generation started here and never stopped widening.</p><p>By the time you hit your fifties, you were senior leadership, or you weren't going to be. You mentored younger workers who didn't understand why you expected loyalty, why you answered emails at midnight, why you showed up when you were sick. The generational friction you felt was real. Your rules were different. You learned them the hard way, and you expected everyone else to do the same.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Your generation revolutionized dating, marriage, and divorce. You came of age during the sexual revolution, when the Pill became widely available and premarital sex became less scandalous. You rejected your parents' expectations of early marriage and separate spheres. Then many of you got married young anyway, because revolution is easier in theory than practice.</p><p>The divorce rate doubled during your prime marrying years. By 1980, when you were 24, nearly half of marriages ended in divorce. Your generation normalized divorce as an option, not a scandal. Some of you are on your second or third marriages. Some of you stayed in unhappy first marriages because the alternative seemed worse. Nobody found the perfect answer.</p><p>You communicated through letters, then phone calls, then email—in that order. Long-distance relationships meant long-distance phone bills. Staying in touch required effort and postage stamps. You couldn't casually text someone. You had to decide they were worth the cost of a call. That limitation shaped how you valued relationships.</p><p>Your generation raised kids during the transition from latchkey childhood to helicopter parenting. You gave your kids more supervision than you got, which was either correction or overcorrection depending on who you ask. You wanted them to have every opportunity, which meant activities, tutoring, college prep, and schedules that would have seemed insane to your free-range childhood.</p><p>Many of you are grandparents now, navigating relationships across generational divides. Your kids think you're on your phone too much (ironic, since they complain about their kids doing the same thing). Your grandkids teach you technology. You teach them... what, exactly? Patience? Perspective? The knowledge that things were different once, and will be different again?</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your generation accumulated more wealth than any generation in American history. By 2020, Boomers controlled over 50% of the nation's wealth. You bought houses when they were affordable. You invested in stocks during the longest bull market in history. You had pensions, and 401(k)s, and Social Security that will actually pay out. The economic timing of your birth was, statistically speaking, extraordinary.</p><p>But the averages hide enormous variation. Some Boomers are millionaires. Some are broke. The divergence started in the '80s and never stopped. If you were in the right industry, the right city, the right demographic, you prospered. If you weren't, you didn't. Your generation invented both the concept of the comfortable retirement and the concept of working until you die.</p><p>Your financial psychology was shaped by the '70s stagflation and the '80s recovery. You learned that economies can crater and that they can also come roaring back. This made you both cautious and optimistic—a combination that served you well during your accumulation years but sometimes makes you tone-deaf to younger generations' struggles.</p><p>You've been lectured about spending by your parents (the Depression generation, who saved compulsively) and lectured about hoarding by your kids (who can't afford houses you bought for the price of their student loans). You're stuck in the middle, defending your wealth to people who have less and your moderation to people who had more.</p><p>The biggest financial decision of your life was probably housing. If you bought property in the right place at the right time, you're sitting on a fortune. If you rented, or bought in the wrong market, you missed the biggest wealth-building opportunity of the century. Real estate made Boomer wealth, and real estate prices are why your kids can't afford to live near you.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is believing your success was entirely earned. You worked hard—nobody disputes that—but you also worked during an era of unprecedented economic expansion, rising wages, affordable housing, and functioning social safety nets. The ladder you climbed has rungs missing now. It's harder to see that from the top.</p><p>You sometimes confuse systemic advantages with personal virtue. 'I worked my way through college' hits different when college cost $500 a semester and minimum wage covered rent. 'I bought my first house at 25' lands differently when that house cost two years' salary instead of ten. Your success was real, but the conditions that enabled it are gone.</p><p>You're uncomfortable with the concept of structural inequality because acknowledging it complicates the narrative of meritocracy you were raised on. If hard work always pays off, then people who haven't succeeded must not be working hard. This logic breaks down under scrutiny, but it's psychologically difficult to abandon because it would mean questioning everything you believe about your own achievements.</p><p>Your generation tends to underestimate how much has changed. 'When I was your age' comparisons ignore inflation, wage stagnation, healthcare costs, and housing prices. The world you navigated in your twenties doesn't exist anymore. Your advice, while well-intentioned, is sometimes obsolete.</p><p>You also have a complicated relationship with your own contradictions. You were hippies who became executives. Protesters who became politicians. Idealists who became pragmatists. That evolution is human and understandable, but it's hard to lecture younger generations about selling out when your generation wrote the playbook.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1976-1986):</strong> You entered adulthood during economic uncertainty—stagflation, oil shocks, malaise. But you found your footing. You got jobs, got married (maybe), started families (maybe). The economy recovered. Reagan promised morning in America. By the end of your twenties, things were looking up. You were building careers, buying houses, living the life your parents promised.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1986-1996):</strong> Your peak family-building and career-climbing years. If you had kids, they were young. If you had ambition, you were chasing it. The economy boomed, then busted in 1987, then boomed again. The Cold War ended. The Soviet Union collapsed. History declared itself over, and you were winning.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1996-2006):</strong> Your earning prime. You were senior enough to matter, young enough to hustle. The dot-com boom made paper millionaires, then the bust took it back. 9/11 changed everything—security, travel, the national mood. But you were established by then. Your career could weather turbulence. Your kids were teenagers, which brought different challenges.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2006-2016):</strong> The 2008 financial crisis hit when you were 52. If you were planning to retire early, those plans changed. If your 401(k) was your retirement plan, you watched it drop 40%. But you had time to recover, unlike people closer to retirement. You adapted, delayed, recalculated. Your kids left home, came back, left again. The sandwich generation years hit hard—aging parents, boomerang kids, your own mortality becoming visible.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2016-2026):</strong> You're in this decade now, or just finishing it. Retirement, if you've achieved it, looks different than your parents' retirement. You're healthier, more active, more likely to work part-time or consult. Your grandkids are growing up in a world you barely recognize. You're the elder now, the keeper of stories about what things used to be like. You're also watching your own health, your own limitations, your own mortality with increasing attention.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2026+):</strong> You'll be the first generation to routinely live into your eighties and nineties. Medical advances you funded with your tax dollars will keep you alive longer than your parents lived. The question isn't lifespan—it's healthspan. How many of those years will be good ones? You're planning for decades of retirement, which nobody in history has had to do before. You're improvising, like you always have.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.2 million people born in 1956. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US, making it one of the largest generations in American history. Your sheer numbers have shaped every institution you've touched, from schools that had to build additions to housing markets that inflate when you buy and deflate when you sell.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were louder, more rebellious, and more numerous. They grew up during Depression and war. You grew up during prosperity and peace (relatively speaking). They valued conformity and stability. You valued self-expression and change. They think you're spoiled. You think they're repressed. Both are probably right.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more optimistic, more idealistic, and significantly wealthier. Gen X grew up in your shadow, the forgotten middle child between Boomer cultural dominance and Millennial digital natives. They watched you get the jobs, the houses, the promotions. They developed a sardonic edge as a survival mechanism. They're still waiting for you to retire so they can finally run things.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering and uncomfortable. You had affordable college; they have crushing debt. You had pensions; they have gig economy jobs. You bought houses for two years' salary; they spend two years' salary on rent. The tension between Boomers and Millennials is really a tension about economic inequality dressed up as cultural conflict.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you might as well be from different planets. They don't remember a world before smartphones, social media, or school shootings. They've never known economic security or climate stability. They're pragmatic in ways that look cynical to you and realistic to them. You're their grandparents, if not biologically then culturally.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've already beaten that. Medical advances, better nutrition, and (for some of you) better healthcare have extended Boomer lifespans into the eighties and beyond. You're the longest-lived generation in history, which means you're also the generation most likely to outlive your savings—a problem nobody planned for because nobody expected it.</p>"
