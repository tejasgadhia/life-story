      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1976-1988</h2><p>Children born during America's Bicentennial arrived into a country engaged in aggressive self-celebration — tall ships, fireworks, commemorative everything — that couldn't quite disguise the uncertainty underneath. The economy was shaky. The presidency was still recovering from Watergate. The Vietnam War had ended the year before in something that wasn't quite defeat but wasn't anything else either. This cohort would have no memory of the celebration itself, but they'd grow up surrounded by its artifacts: the commemorative plates, the red-white-and-blue souvenirs, the lingering sense that the party had been thrown to compensate for something.</p><p>Their conscious childhood began in the early 1980s, and the 1980s felt different from what came before. Reagan was in the White House. The national mood had pivoted from Carter's honest pessimism to a kind of cinematic optimism — big, bright, and resistant to complication. Children experienced this as a general lightening of the household atmosphere. The worried conversations about gas prices and inflation that had defined their parents' late seventies gave way to something more expansive, even if the expansion didn't reach every household equally.</p><p>The two-income family was now the default rather than the exception. Both parents worked because both parents had to, or because mothers had discovered that working was preferable to not working, or because some combination of economic necessity and personal ambition had restructured the American household without anyone voting on it. For children, the practical result was the same: afternoons spent alone or with siblings, navigating the hours between school and dinner without adult supervision. They heated their own snacks, arbitrated their own disputes, and learned to be comfortable in empty rooms. This was not trauma. It was just Tuesday.</p><p>At seven, The Day After aired on ABC and brought the Cold War's abstract threat into the living room with unprecedented specificity. A hundred million people watched Kansas City get vaporized by Soviet missiles. Parents who had treated nuclear anxiety as background noise suddenly had to discuss it as foreground reality. For children, the film crystallized something they'd sensed without being able to name: that the world they lived in was genuinely precarious, that the adults managing it were genuinely uncertain, and that the cheerful confidence of the Reagan era coexisted with an existential threat that nobody had actually resolved.</p><p>School in the mid-1980s was orderly, test-driven, and largely unremarkable. The pendulum had swung fully from the experimental seventies to the standardized eighties. Children sat in rows, completed worksheets, memorized facts for tests that measured retention rather than understanding. The gifted programs and academic tracks that sorted children by perceived ability were well established, and by fourth or fifth grade most children had a fairly clear sense of where they stood in the institutional hierarchy. The system worked, in the narrow sense that it produced graduates. Whether it inspired anyone was a question nobody seemed to be asking.</p><p>At ten, the Challenger exploded on live television, and classrooms across the country watched a teacher die seventy-three seconds into what was supposed to be a triumph. For this cohort, the event was formative in a way that defied easy summary. It wasn't just the tragedy — it was the context. They'd been told to watch because it was going to be wonderful. Instead, it was catastrophic. The gap between what was promised and what was delivered became, in that moment, the organizing principle of their relationship with institutions. Trust, they learned, was a bet. Sometimes you lost.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Gen X Generation</h2><p>Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. The slacker generation. The latchkey kids. The demographic asterisk between the massive Boomer cohort and the even larger Millennials—perpetually overlooked, perpetually underestimated, and honestly? Fine with it.</p><p>There are roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Gen Xers in the US, making this the smallest living generation. Sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials. Gen X has spent its entire adult life being ignored by marketers obsessed with Boomers and then Millennials. This has advantages. Nobody blames Gen X for killing industries. Nobody writes think pieces about Gen X avocado consumption. This generation exists in the cultural blindspot, which suits it just fine.</p><p>Gen X's defining characteristic is skepticism hardened into reflex. This cohort watched Watergate unfold in real time—parents glued to hearings where every authority figure turned out to be a liar. Gen X grew up during stagflation, gas lines, the Iranian hostage crisis that made America look impotent on the world stage. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span> Trust no one wasn't paranoia. It was pattern recognition.</p><p>Gen X is the divorce generation. The divorce rate peaked in 1980, when this cohort was four. More Gen Xers grew up in broken homes than any generation before. They came home to empty houses, microwaved their own dinners, did homework alone until a parent got home from work. This made Gen X self-reliant in ways that look like detachment to people who had more supervision. Gen X didn't have helicopter parents. Gen X barely had parents who landed.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, Gen X was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Culturally, Gen X invented ironic distance as a survival mechanism. Earnestness was embarrassing—it meant vulnerability. Everything was either stupid or a joke or both. Gen X built alternative rock, slacker comedies, and the studied pose of not caring even when desperately caring. Kurt Cobain wearing a dress on MTV wasn't fashion. It was armor. The flannel was armor. The sarcasm was armor. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X can still entertain itself without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Rocky won Best Picture in 1976—Sylvester Stallone punching the American Dream in the face, proving an underdog could go the distance even if he didn't win. Taxi Driver gave us 'You talkin' to me?' Network gave us 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.' All the President's Men made journalism look heroic, and parents thought it mattered. 1976 was peak cynical '70s cinema, the last gasp before blockbusters took over.</p><p>The childhood soundtrack started with Fleetwood Mac's Rumours (1977), which parents played until the vinyl wore thin. The Eagles' 'Hotel California' was everywhere—that guitar outro burned into memory before the lyrics were understood. Disco peaked with the Bee Gees and Saturday Night Fever in 1977, then died so fast it barely registered. By five, MTV launched, and music became visual. Duran Duran's 'Hungry Like the Wolf' was learned as much from the video as the song.</p><p>Television raised children as much as parents did. Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, Charlie's Angels, The Six Million Dollar Man—these were babysitters. Saturday Night Live was in its first dangerous seasons, Chevy Chase falling down and saying things children weren't supposed to hear. By eight, kids had graduated to The A-Team, Knight Rider, and whatever action show let them imagine a more exciting life than suburban boredom.</p><p>Star Wars owned childhood. The film premiered when children were one, Empire Strikes Back revealed Vader was Luke's father when they were four (the greatest spoiler of the generation), Return of the Jedi wrapped the trilogy when they were seven. There effectively wasn't a world before Star Wars—not for kids, not for toys, not for movies. George Lucas rewired what entertainment could be.</p><p>By adolescence, Gen X was deep in John Hughes territory. The Breakfast Club when kids were nine, Ferris Bueller's Day Off when they were ten, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles—these were instruction manuals for surviving high school, for understanding that adults were clueless and teenage angst was valid. Molly Ringwald was Gen X's face. Every word of 'Don't You (Forget About Me)' was known, fists raised at the freeze frame.</p><p>High school brought alternative rock as the personal soundtrack. R.E.M., The Smiths, The Cure—sad music for kids who couldn't explain why they were sad. Then Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' detonated in 1991 when Gen X was fifteen, and suddenly the underground was mainstream. Kurt Cobain's howl was Gen X's howl. Flannel shirts became a uniform. MTV's Unplugged sessions replaced the glossy hair-metal videos. Gen X was there for grunge's three-year reign before it died with Kurt in 1994.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>Apple Computer was founded in a Cupertino garage in 1976. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were hand-building circuit boards while children were learning to walk. The Apple I sold for $666.66—a number that seemed punk rock before punk rock existed. The personal computer revolution was beginning, and Gen X would grow up alongside it, neither fully native nor completely foreign.</p><p>At three, the Sony Walkman arrived, and suddenly music was portable. Children could carry their own soundtrack everywhere—on the school bus, walking to a friend's house, tuning out parents' arguments. Those orange foam headphones became extensions of skulls. Thousands of AA batteries were killed rewinding favorite songs.</p><p>Childhood was pre-digital but not pre-electronic. There was television (three networks, PBS, and UHF static), radio, cassette tapes recorded off the radio with fingers hovering over the pause button to cut out commercials. VCRs arrived around age seven, and suddenly time-shifting was possible—recording shows, renting movies from the new Blockbuster down the street. The tracking knob became second nature.</p><p>At nine, the IBM PC launched. At twelve, the Macintosh arrived with its friendly 'hello' and its revolutionary mouse. Apple IIe computers appeared in schools—green text on black screens, Oregon Trail killing oxen and parties from dysentery. Papers were typed on typewriters first, then word processors, learning to save obsessively after losing a document to a power surge once.</p><p>The internet arrived when Gen X was in college or just after. Dial-up's screeching handshake, the AOL 'You've got mail' that meant something before it became a punchline. Email was learned, then chat rooms, then the early web—GeoCities pages with construction-cone GIFs, search engines before Google made them good. Gen X were early adopters but not digital natives. The internet was learned as an adult skill, like driving or taxes.</p><p>This gives Gen X a peculiar fluency. This generation functions without constant connectivity because it remembers life without it. Gen X can read a paper map, use a card catalog, calculate a tip without a phone. Technology is understood as a tool picked up, not an environment born into. Gen X are translators between the analog world and the digital one, comfortable in both, native to neither.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Viking 1 landed on Mars four months after birth in 1976 and transmitted the first photographs from another planet's surface.</span> Children were busy learning to hold their heads up, but it was the culmination of everything the Space Age promised. Humans were reaching beyond Earth, even if only through machines. The future was arriving on schedule.</p><p>At four, Mount St. Helens exploded, and children learned mountains could kill people. At five, Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton, and children watched parents watch the news with a fear they didn't understand. That same year, AIDS was first identified, though it would be years before children understood what it meant or how it would reshape everything from dating to politics to who got to be considered human.</p><p>At five, the first Space Shuttle launched. At ten, the Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after liftoff, probably on a television wheeled into classrooms because a teacher was going to space. Christa McAuliffe was supposed to broadcast lessons from orbit. Instead, children watched the Y-shaped smoke trail and learned that progress has costs, that live television can traumatize an entire generation simultaneously, that adults weren't as in control as they pretended.</p><p>Gen X grew up in the Cold War's shadow. Duck-and-cover drills nobody believed would help. The Day After and WarGames made it understood, viscerally, that the world could end at any moment, that there were missiles pointed at houses right now. At thirteen, the Berlin Wall fell—people with sledgehammers chipping away at concrete while guards who would have shot them a week earlier just watched. The existential threat Gen X had been raised to fear evaporated overnight. Gen X wasn't sure what to replace it with.</p><p>At fifteen, the Gulf War became the first televised war—CNN's coming-out party, green night-vision footage that looked like a video game. At eighteen, the Soviet Union dissolved. The empire that had defined childhood fears simply stopped existing. At nineteen, the World Trade Center was bombed the first time—a preview nobody recognized as a preview.</p><p>At twenty-three, Oklahoma City. At twenty-three, Columbine—though Gen X was old enough that it felt like someone else's nightmare, high school already behind them. At twenty-five, Y2K fizzled into nothing. At twenty-five, Bush v. Gore taught Gen X that elections could be contested in daylight if enough powerful people agreed to look away.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, Gen X was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Old enough to be working, to have apartments, to understand exactly what was being watched and what it meant. Gen X probably knew someone who knew someone. Gen X definitely knew the skyline. The before and after of that day is cleaner for Gen X than for younger generations. Gen X had a quarter-century of 'before.' Everything since has been 'after.'</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Gen X entered the workforce in the late '90s, when the NASDAQ was a rocket ship and anyone who could spell 'HTML' had a job offer. The dot-com boom felt like the rules had changed—equity over salary, ping-pong tables over pensions, twenty-three-year-olds becoming millionaires while Gen X was still figuring out how fax machines worked. Stock options were worth something before 2000, or they became expensive wallpaper.</p><p>Gen X learned the fundamental lesson of modern employment before Millennials even graduated: loyalty is a sucker's bet. This generation watched parents get laid off by companies they'd given decades to—pension promises evaporating, gold watches replaced by cardboard boxes. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> Gen X inherited the wreckage and adapted.</p><p>Gen X normalized job-hopping before it had a name. Not out of flightiness—out of self-preservation. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> Gen X learned to climb by moving laterally, to negotiate by having options, to keep resumes warm because employers would replace workers the moment the spreadsheet suggested it. Gen X doesn't trust companies because companies gave Gen X every reason not to.</p><p>The dot-com crash hit when Gen X was twenty-four, wiping out the easy money and the illusion that growth only went up. Gen X survived. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived—Gen X was established enough to weather it, but still young enough to lose years of accumulated progress.</span> Many Gen Xers lost houses during the subprime collapse. Many lost jobs. All lost the assumption that playing by the rules meant security.</p><p>COVID arrived when Gen X was forty-four, maybe managing people, maybe finally in positions of authority. Suddenly Gen X was navigating remote work, Zoom fatigue, and the realization that the office had been held together by proximity rather than necessity. Gen X adapted because adapting is what this generation does. From typewriters to word processors to smartphones, from fax machines to email to Slack pinging at midnight—Gen X learned every system because the alternative was obsolescence. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X didn't complain about it—Gen X just did the work. That's this generation's legacy: competence without fanfare.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Gen X is the last generation that dated without algorithms. This cohort met people at parties, through friends, in line at coffee shops, at record stores flipping through the same section. Phone numbers were exchanged on napkins. Calls went to answering machines—those actual machines with tiny cassettes—and decisions had to be made: leave a message or hang up and try again, knowing the click would be recorded either way.</p><p>Gen X relationships evolved alongside communication technology. Landlines to cordless phones to car phones to cell phones to smartphones. Letters to faxes to emails to texts to DMs. Long-distance calls cost money—Gen X remembers the anxiety of watching minutes tick by, knowing parents would see the bill. Calling cards, 1-800-COLLECT, the innovations that made staying connected slightly less expensive.</p><p>Gen X married later than parents but earlier than Millennials. The median marriage age for this cohort was around twenty-five—still young by today's standards. Many Gen Xers divorced, because this generation normalized divorce in ways previous generations hadn't. Gen X saw parents' marriages fail and learned that staying together 'for the kids' often meant staying together to traumatize the kids. Better to split than to model misery.</p><p>Friendships for Gen X tend to be smaller circles, deeper bonds, less performative than the social-media-driven connections that followed. Gen X has friends known for thirty years. This generation doesn't need to post about the friendship to make it real. Gen X is comfortable with silence in ways younger generations aren't—a friend not talked to in six months is still a friend. Gen X picks up where it left off without needing to apologize for the gap. Maintenance isn't measured in likes.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during Gen X's prime earning years.</span> The dot-com crash when Gen X was twenty-four, watching paper millionaires become regular broke people overnight. The 2008 financial collapse when Gen X was thirty-two, learning that houses could be worth less than paid for them, that banks could fail, that 'too big to fail' meant too big for consequences. COVID when Gen X was forty-four, watching the market crater and recover while small businesses died and billionaires got richer.</p><p>Gen X's financial advantages over Millennials are real but often overstated. Yes, college was cheaper when Gen X went—a year at a state school might have been $2,000, not $20,000. Yes, houses were more affordable when Gen X first bought—a starter home didn't require a six-figure down payment. But Gen X also got hit by 2008 in early thirties, when this generation should have been accumulating wealth. Many Gen Xers lost houses. Many lost jobs. The market dropped <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span> in 2008, and Gen X's 401(k)s dropped with it.</p><p>Gen X is the 401(k) generation—the first to fund their own retirements instead of relying on company pensions. This generation watched the shift happen in real time. Defined benefits became defined contributions. Companies transferred risk from themselves to workers, called it 'empowerment,' and pocketed the savings. Gen X had to become amateur financial planners—learning about expense ratios and asset allocation—because nobody was going to manage retirement for them. Mortgage rates hit <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span> in the early '80s when parents were buying—Gen X inherited their financial anxiety.</p><p>A house in 1990, when Gen X was fourteen, cost about 2.5 times the median income. Today it's over six times. Gen X got in early enough to benefit, but not early enough to coast.</p><p>Gen X's relationship with money is pragmatic, shaped by watching systems fail. Gen X saves because this generation has seen what happens when people don't. Gen X invests because Social Security feels like a gamble, not a guarantee. Gen X diversifies because this generation has watched single bets—dot-com stocks, real estate, employer stock—destroy people who trusted too much. Gen X isn't optimistic about money. Gen X is prepared.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Gen X's biggest blind spot is mistaking cynicism for wisdom. This generation grew up distrustful—Watergate, stagflation, nuclear anxiety, parental divorce—and that distrust has served Gen X well. Gen X doesn't fall for scams as easily. Gen X reads the fine print. Gen X assumes the worst and is pleasantly surprised by neutral. But somewhere along the line, healthy skepticism calcified into reflexive dismissal. Gen X rejects earnestness because earnestness burned this generation once. But earnestness isn't always naivete, and dismissing it preemptively means missing things that matter.</p><p>Gen X is so used to being overlooked that this generation has made invisibility a virtue. Gen X prides itself on not needing attention, on doing the work without credit, on being the competent adult in the room. But sometimes that means Gen X doesn't advocate for itself when it should. Gen X lets Boomers dominate leadership positions and Millennials dominate cultural conversations while Gen X does the actual work of keeping systems running. Being underestimated is only an advantage if Gen X eventually uses it.</p><p>Gen X's ironic distance reads as apathy to people who don't know the code. Gen X cares—about climate change, about inequality, about the systems failing Gen X's kids—but this generation is uncomfortable expressing that care without a protective layer of sarcasm. This makes it hard for younger people to take Gen X seriously as allies. They can't tell if Gen X is with them or mocking them from the sidelines. The armor Gen X built in the '80s still fits, but it's become its own kind of prison.</p><p>Gen X adapted to so many broken systems that this generation has forgotten they could be different. Gen X is expert at survival within constraints—making bad jobs tolerable, making insufficient salaries stretch, making peace with injustice because fighting it seemed pointless. But survival isn't the same as thriving, and accepting constraints isn't the same as changing them. Gen X learned to work around problems instead of demanding they be fixed. Sometimes that's wisdom. Sometimes it's capitulation.</p><p>Gen X's self-reliance can become isolation, and Gen X has normalized that too. This generation figured things out alone as latchkey kids, and Gen X still defaults to handling everything itself. Asking for help feels like weakness, like admitting the independence Gen X built its identity around was always partly a coping mechanism. But refusing help isn't strength. It's just stubbornness with better branding, and it leaves Gen X carrying weight it doesn't have to carry alone.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Gen X's 20s (1996-2006):</strong> This generation graduated into the best economy in decades. The dot-com boom made everyone feel rich, even the people who weren't. Stock options were handed out like candy. Companies with no revenue had billion-dollar valuations. Gen X probably had multiple jobs before thirty—not because Gen X couldn't commit, but because the market rewarded movement and punished loyalty. This was the decade of possibility, of Pets.com and Webvan and the sincere belief that the old rules were obsolete. Then the bubble popped in 2000, and Gen X learned the old rules were just waiting.</p><p><strong>Gen X's 30s (2006-2016):</strong> The 2008 financial crisis hit Gen X in early thirties—established enough to have something to lose, young enough that losing it meant starting over. Maybe Gen X lost houses to the subprime collapse. Maybe Gen X lost jobs when companies 'restructured.' Maybe Gen X just watched 401(k)s crater and learned that diversification doesn't help when everything falls at once. This was supposed to be Gen X's building decade, when career advancement and compound interest worked together to create security. Instead, it was survival. Gen X learned that playing by the rules doesn't protect from systemic failure.</p><p><strong>Gen X's 40s (2016-2026):</strong> Gen X is here now, probably at peak earning potential, definitely at peak responsibility. Gen X's kids, if this generation has them, might be teenagers discovering their own problems. Gen X's parents are aging, starting to need more than phone calls. Gen X is sandwiched—managing down (employees, children) and managing up (aging parents, senior leadership who won't retire). COVID hit at forty-four and proved that working from home was always possible; they just didn't want Gen X to know. This is the decade where Gen X either consolidates what it's built or realizes it needs to change course entirely. Both options are valid. Neither is easy.</p><p><strong>Gen X's 50s (2026-2036):</strong> The decade of reckoning approaches. Is Gen X on track for retirement? (The honest answer is probably 'close but not quite.') How's Gen X's health? (This becomes the dominant question, slowly and then suddenly.) Does Gen X still like its work, or just need it? Gen X will age into a healthcare system buckling under Boomer demand, which means Gen X's care will be rationed one way or another. Gen X will watch parents decline. Gen X will become the oldest generation in families, which is a strange and quiet transition nobody prepares for.</p><p><strong>Gen X's 60s and beyond (2036+):</strong> Retirement, for most Gen Xers, won't look like parents' version—the pension, the gold watch, the leisurely decades on Social Security that actually covered expenses. Gen X will probably work longer than planned, either by choice or necessity. The goalpost will move. But here's what Gen X has: adaptability. Gen X has been adapting its whole life—to technology shifts, to economic crashes, to rules that changed while Gen X was following them. One more adjustment is just Tuesday. And at least Gen X won't be bored.</p>"

That makes Gen X the smallest living cohort, squeezed between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers who won't leave the stage and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials who keep being told the stage is theirs.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> Boomers got the postwar boom, Gen X got the post-Vietnam malaise. Boomers bought houses for two years' salary, Gen X bought houses for four (and counted itself lucky). Boomers had pensions, Gen X had 401(k)s and the vague suggestion to 'diversify.' Boomers spent careers at one or two companies that rewarded loyalty; Gen X learned loyalty was a trap by watching Boomers get laid off anyway. Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth at Gen X's age; Gen X controls about 9%. The math isn't close.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> Gen X is more financially stable but also more cynical. Gen X had advantages Millennials didn't—cheaper tuition, earlier entry into housing markets, less crushing student debt. But Gen X also had less support, less parental involvement, less safety net. Gen X raised itself while both parents worked. Millennials were raised by helicopter parents who scheduled playdates and intervened in conflicts. Neither approach was perfect. Gen X's just hurt differently.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Gen X is practically prehistoric to Gen Z. Gen X grew up without the internet; Gen Z has never known a world without it. Gen X remembers privacy, remembers boredom, remembers being unreachable. Gen Z has been documented since birth, tracked since adolescence, marketed to since they could swipe. Gen X is confused by Gen Z's simultaneous optimism and nihilism, Gen Z's ability to meme through disaster. Gen Z seems both more fragile and more resilient than Gen X understands. Maybe Gen Z is just adapting, the way Gen X did. Maybe adaptation looks different now.</p><p>Gen X's life expectancy is around <span class=\"stat-box\">76-78</span> years—similar to Boomers, though Gen X shows elevated rates of substance-related health challenges (suicide, overdose, alcohol-related). Gen X is healthier than previous generations in some ways, sicker in others. Gen X will need healthcare longer than parents did and trusts the system to provide it less.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X is the forgotten middle child of American generations.</span> Not idealistic like Boomers claimed to be. Not optimistic like Millennials were before 2008 broke them. Not nihilistic like Gen Z performs online. Just pragmatic, skeptical, self-reliant to a fault, and quietly doing the work while everyone argues about who ruined what. Someone has to keep the systems running while the other generations fight. Might as well be Gen X.</p>"
