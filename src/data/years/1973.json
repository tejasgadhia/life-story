      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1973-1985</h2><p>The smell of vinyl car seats in summer. The taste of Tang mixed wrong—too sweet, too orange, stirred with a long-handled spoon in a Tupperware pitcher. The scratch of shag carpet against your knees while you played with Hot Wheels on the orange-and-brown floor. Your childhood had textures that don't exist anymore.</p><p>You were born into harvest gold and avocado green. Every kitchen had those colors. Every living room had wood paneling and a console TV the size of a coffin. Your parents smoked Winstons or Virginia Slims inside the house, inside the car, inside restaurants where the 'non-smoking section' was three feet away from the smoking section. The whole world smelled like secondhand smoke and Aqua Net.</p><p>At four, you watched Star Wars in a packed theater, and your brain rewired itself forever. You begged for the action figures—Luke, Han, Chewie—and your parents paid $2.49 each, not knowing those same figures would sell for thousands someday. You built Death Stars out of cardboard boxes. You made lightsaber sounds with your mouth that you still remember exactly how to make.</p><p>Your toys could kill you, and nobody cared. Lawn darts with actual metal spikes. Clackers that shattered and sent acrylic shrapnel everywhere. The Fisher-Price record player you could pinch your fingers in. Big Wheels that launched you into traffic. Stretch Armstrong filled with corn syrup that your dog would eat if you left him out. You survived because luck is real.</p><p>You ate TV dinners in compartmentalized aluminum trays—the Salisbury steak with its mysterious gravy, the apple cobbler that burned your tongue, the mashed potatoes with that thin skin on top. Hamburger Helper for dinner. Pop-Tarts for breakfast (no toasting—straight from the foil). Kool-Aid by the gallon, red #40 staining your upper lip. Your parents gave you Tang because astronauts drank it, and astronauts were basically gods.</p><p>At twelve, you watched the Challenger explode on live television. Your teacher had wheeled in the TV cart because Christa McAuliffe was making history. Instead, you watched seven people die at 11:39 AM on a Tuesday, and every adult in the room went silent in a way that scared you more than the explosion itself. That was your generation's first shared trauma—the moment you learned that even rockets could fail, even heroes could die, even NASA could get it wrong.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Gen X</h2><p>Gen X. The forgotten middle child. The latchkey generation. The slackers. You've been called everything except what you actually are: the generation that watched the American Dream curdle and decided to laugh about it instead of cry.</p><p>You were one year old when Nixon resigned in disgrace. Two when Saigon fell. Four when Star Wars proved fantasy could be more comforting than reality. Eight when Reagan told you it was Morning in America while your parents' friends got laid off. The institutions that your grandparents trusted and your parents questioned—you learned not to trust them at all.</p><p>Your generation is 65 million strong, sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials. You're the demographic trough, the marketing afterthought, the generation that advertisers couldn't quite figure out because you saw through every sales pitch. You'd been advertised to since birth—Saturday morning commercials for Cap'n Crunch, G.I. Joe, and breakfast cereals with mascots. By the time you were a teenager, you were fluent in manipulation and immune to sincerity.</p><p>Divorce shaped you more than any political event. By 1980, half of all marriages ended in divorce, and you watched it happen in your house or your friends' houses. Your parents told you it wasn't your fault—the first generation to hear that specific therapy-speak—and you believed them, mostly. You learned to be self-sufficient because you had to be. Nobody was coming to save you. Not your parents, not the government, not the corporations that would lay off your dad on a Tuesday.</p><p>The defining Gen X mood is ironic detachment—not because you don't care, but because caring too much seemed dangerous. You watched Boomers' idealism turn into yuppie materialism. You watched flower children become corporate raiders. You learned that if you invest too much in anything, it will let you down, so you hedged everything with sarcasm. Cynicism as self-defense. Whatever as philosophy.</p><p>You're the last generation that can remember life before the internet, before cell phones, before GPS, before everything was tracked and recorded. You know what genuine privacy felt like. You know what it was like to disappear for a few hours. That's either wisdom or obsolescence, depending on who's asking.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, The Exorcist made audiences physically vomit in theaters. The Godfather swept the Oscars. Pink Floyd released The Dark Side of the Moon—an album you wouldn't appreciate until college, when you'd play it synced to The Wizard of Oz at 2 AM and swear it was intentional. American Graffiti made everyone nostalgic for a 1962 that was ten years ago and already felt like ancient history. Nostalgia was getting faster.</p><p>Your parents' turntable played Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and The Carpenters singing about rainy days and Mondays. Jim Croce died in a plane crash four months after you were born—you'd grow up hearing 'Time in a Bottle' at weddings without knowing the guy was already gone. Classic rock was your lullaby music before it was classic.</p><p>At four, Star Wars happened, and nothing was ever the same. You weren't just watching a movie—you were being inducted into a religion. You collected the action figures: Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca (whose name you couldn't pronounce), Darth Vader. You had the lunchbox. The bedsheets. The Underoos. When Empire came out at seven, and Vader said 'I am your father,' your mind broke open. The villain was the hero's dad? Stories could do that?</p><p>Saturday mornings were Schoolhouse Rock ('Conjunction Junction'), Super Friends, Scooby-Doo, and The Smurfs. You ate Froot Loops and Cap'n Crunch in front of the TV while commercials taught you to want things you didn't need—Stretch Armstrong, Evel Knievel stunt cycles, Easy-Bake Ovens that could actually burn you. By eight, you could recite the preamble to the Constitution because of a cartoon. Nobody planned that. It just happened.</p><p>At eleven, MTV launched, and you watched it rewire culture in real time. You saw Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' premiere. You watched Madonna roll around on the floor at the VMAs singing 'Like a Virgin' while your parents asked what the hell was happening to America. You absorbed Duran Duran, Cyndi Lauper, Prince in that purple everything. Music became visual, and you were fluent before adults understood the grammar.</p><p>High school was John Hughes. The Breakfast Club at twelve—you knew which character you were and who you wanted to be. Sixteen Candles at eleven, Ferris Bueller's Day Off at thirteen, Pretty in Pink at thirteen. Hughes understood suburban teenage loneliness better than your guidance counselor. Molly Ringwald was your generation's mascot before anyone called you a generation.</p><p>Then grunge arrived to kill everything that came before. You were eighteen when Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' dropped, and suddenly all that ironic detachment you'd been practicing had a soundtrack. Kurt Cobain in that moth-eaten cardigan, screaming about teen spirit like he was talking directly to you. He probably was. Three years later, he was dead, and you learned that some alienation couldn't be survived.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year you were born, Motorola engineer Martin Cooper made the first handheld cell phone call—a brick-sized prototype that cost $3,995 and wouldn't reach consumers for another decade. Ethernet was invented at Xerox PARC. The pocket calculator dropped below $100 for the first time, and your dad probably bought one to balance his checkbook. Technology in 1973 was mainframes and punch cards, rotary phones and typewriters. The future existed only in labs.</p><p>Your first video game was probably Pong—that hypnotic bounce, those beeps, that moment when you realized a television could be interactive. You played it at an arcade or on an Atari 2600 at a friend's house. Space Invaders arrived when you were five. You pumped quarters into it at the mall, at Pizza Hut, at any establishment that had one of those mysterious cabinet machines. Pac-Man at seven. Donkey Kong at eight. You developed hand-eye coordination that would prove directly transferable to exactly nothing in adult life, and indirectly transferable to everything.</p><p>At eleven, the Macintosh launched with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial—that hammer through the screen, Big Brother shattered, the promise that personal computers would set you free. You were too young to buy one, but you knew something had shifted. At thirteen, you got a Commodore 64 or an Apple IIe in the den. You played Oregon Trail and died of dysentery. You learned BASIC programming from library books because there was no other way to learn. You typed LOAD\"*\",8,1 and waited forever for something to happen.</p><p>Your college experience involved card catalogs and the Dewey Decimal System. You wrote papers on a typewriter, or if you were lucky, a word processor that looked like a typewriter had a baby with a microwave. Research meant microfiche—that particular whirring sound, the eye strain, the neck ache from hunching over those machines in the library basement. If you wanted to know something, you looked it up. In a book. Made of paper. This took time, and that time taught you patience you'd later forget you had.</p><p>At eighteen, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, but you wouldn't touch it until your twenties. Email arrived at your workplace in your mid-twenties—you thought it was a fad. You got your first cell phone around twenty-five: a Nokia or Motorola brick that did nothing but make staticky calls, and you paid by the minute, so you didn't. The internet crept into your life on dial-up modems, that screech-and-handshake sound, ten minutes for a single image to load while nobody in the house could use the phone.</p><p>You're the bridge generation. You remember the before times—rotary phones, encyclopedias, getting genuinely lost because MapQuest hadn't printed your directions—but you've spent most of your adult life adapting to the after times. You're fluent in both worlds. You can read a paper map and navigate by GPS. You can write a letter and send a text. You understand what we lost and what we gained, which makes you either wise or nostalgic, depending on how you tell the story.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were you when you first understood the world could fail? That's the Gen X question, and you've had to answer it more times than any generation should.</p><p>You were born into Watergate. The break-in happened the year before; the hearings dominated the summer you arrived. By the time you were one, Nixon was resigning on live television—your parents watching as a president became a criminal in real time. 'I am not a crook' was a punchline before you could talk. You grew up knowing, instinctively, that leaders lie. It wasn't cynicism. It was just observation.</p><p>At six months old, the last American combat troops left Vietnam. The helicopters lifting off from embassy rooftops, the fall of Saigon—you don't remember it, but it shaped everything around you. The veterans came home to silence. The country didn't want to talk about it. You absorbed that lesson: some failures are too big to discuss, so we just... don't.</p><p>At six, the oil crisis hit your family. Gas lines. Odd-even rationing. Your dad cursing OPEC in the station wagon. The post-war abundance your parents had grown up with—the cheap gas, the big cars, the infinite American road—was over. You learned early that resources were finite, that other countries could hurt us, that the future wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>At seven, the Iranian hostage crisis started. You were too young to understand the geopolitics, but you understood the flag-draped anger, the yellow ribbons, the 444 days of impotence that Jimmy Carter couldn't fix. At eight, John Lennon was shot outside his apartment building in New York. You didn't fully understand who he was yet, but you understood the adults were devastated—that someone could just be killed, randomly, for nothing.</p><p>At twelve, Challenger. That's the one that never leaves. Your teacher wheeled in the TV cart because Christa McAuliffe was going to space—a teacher, like your teacher—and you watched her die at 11:39 AM on January 28, 1986. The O-ring failed. The shuttle broke apart. Seven people died on live television, and every kid in America learned simultaneously that even rockets could fail, even NASA could be wrong, even the heroic could die for no good reason.</p><p>At sixteen, the Berlin Wall fell. You watched crowds with sledgehammers, champagne, tears of joy, and something your parents called 'the end of history.' At eighteen, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the Cold War—that nuclear sword that had hung over your entire childhood—just disappeared. No apocalypse. No World War III. Just a quiet implosion and a 'peace dividend' that would never arrive.</p><p>At twenty-eight, 9/11. You were at work, or just getting there. Someone said a plane hit the World Trade Center, and you thought it was a small plane, an accident. Then the second plane hit, and you understood. You watched the towers fall on a television in an office or a bar or a stranger's living room. You knew, instantly, that everything before that moment was 'before' and everything after was 'after.' The wars that followed—Afghanistan, Iraq, the endless War on Terror—you were old enough to know they were wrong but young enough to feel powerless to stop them.</p><p>At thirty-five, the financial system collapsed. You had a mortgage by then, a 401(k), something to lose. You watched half of it evaporate. The banks got bailed out. You didn't. The lesson, again: the system protects itself, not you.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Here's what nobody told you: the social contract was already dead when you signed it.</p><p>You graduated college around 1995, give or take. The economy was recovering from the early '90s recession, but 'recovering' meant entry-level jobs paid $22,000 and required a suit you couldn't afford. You bought that suit at JCPenney with a credit card. You called it an investment. That's what they told you to call it.</p><p>Your parents' career path: get hired, work forty years at the same company, get a pension, get a gold watch, retire. Your path: get hired, watch the company 'restructure,' get laid off, find another job, get 'rightsized,' find another job, abandon any illusion that loyalty would be rewarded. The corporation didn't love your dad, and it definitely doesn't love you.</p><p>At twenty-seven, the dot-com boom happened. You watched twenty-four-year-olds in cargo shorts become millionaires on business plans written on cocktail napkins. Pets.com. Webvan. Companies with no revenue and infinite valuations. Maybe you caught the wave—got hired at a startup, got stock options, cashed out before the crash. More likely, you watched from the sidelines of your stable-ish corporate job and wondered if you'd made a mistake. Then 2000 happened, the bubble burst, and you felt either vindicated or robbed, depending on which side you'd been on.</p><p>By 2008, you were mid-career. You had a title, maybe some direct reports, definitely a mortgage. Then Lehman Brothers collapsed, and suddenly you were expensive. 'Experienced' became a liability. They laid off the highest salaries first—you, or people just like you. The same HR department that praised your performance review gave you a cardboard box and a security escort. You landed on your feet, probably. Gen X always lands on its feet. But the lesson stuck: you're always one quarter away from being a line item someone decides to cut.</p><p>You invented work-life balance as a concept because you watched your Boomer parents sacrifice everything for companies that laid them off anyway. You saw your dad give his life to a corporation that discarded him at fifty-five. You decided not to play that game. You're not disloyal—you're rational. Why would you love something that will never love you back?</p><p>Now you're in leadership positions, managing Millennials who want purpose and Gen Z who want flexibility. You give them what you can because you remember what it was like to be dismissed by people who didn't understand. But quietly, you wonder: are they naive or enlightened? Did you accept too much? Did they learn from your mistakes, or are they making new ones?</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember waiting by the phone? Not the phone in your pocket—the phone attached to the wall with the curly cord that stretched into the hall closet for privacy. You sat there, willing it to ring, knowing that if they called while your mom was talking to Aunt Linda, you'd never know. Call waiting was a luxury. Caller ID was science fiction. Rejection happened without preview, without buffer, without the ability to screenshot it to your group chat.</p><p>You asked people out in person. In person. With your voice, your face, your visible terror. Or you passed a note in class—'Do you like me? Check yes or no'—and watched them read it from across the room. The agony of waiting for that folded paper to come back. The crushing disappointment or the euphoric relief. No emojis. No 'lol.' Just handwriting and eye contact.</p><p>You dated before the algorithm. You met people at parties, at bars, through mutual friends, at work (back when that was still acceptable). You couldn't preview their social media first. You couldn't Google them. You showed up to a date knowing nothing except what they'd told you, which might be true or might be complete fiction. You developed instincts. You read body language. You learned to trust your gut because there was no other data source.</p><p>Your generation invented 'friends with benefits' and 'it's complicated' as relationship categories. Boomers got married at twenty-two. You waited until your late twenties or early thirties—if you got married at all. Cohabitation without marriage became normal. Living together to 'see if it works' made sense to you in ways that scandalized your grandparents. Half of you divorced anyway, but at least you did it without Instagram commentary.</p><p>You know how to be alone. Genuinely, completely alone—unreachable, untrackable, off the grid. You could leave your house without a phone and just... exist somewhere, with no one knowing where you were. This felt normal then. It feels like a superpower now. You can sit in silence without reaching for a screen. You can be bored without needing to fix it. These are skills younger generations will have to consciously develop, if they develop them at all.</p><p>Your friendships are deep but narrow. You didn't accumulate 800 Facebook friends—you maintained maybe a dozen real relationships across your life. Your best friend from high school is still your best friend. Your college roommate knows things about you that your spouse doesn't. You're suspicious of anyone who claims to have hundreds of close connections, because you know the math doesn't work. Intimacy requires time, and time is finite.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You've lived through four economic crises as an adult, and you're expecting the fifth. This isn't pessimism—it's pattern recognition. Early '90s recession. Dot-com bust. 2008 collapse. COVID crash. Every decade brings a new way for the floor to fall out, and every time you're told it was unforeseeable. You've stopped believing that. The floor is made of paper. Act accordingly.</p><p>Your parents got pensions. You got 401(k)s. This was sold as freedom—control your own retirement!—but in practice it meant you've spent thirty years becoming an amateur mutual fund manager, reading Morningstar ratings, trying to figure out if you should be 70/30 stocks-to-bonds or 60/40, while praying the market doesn't crater the year you plan to retire. The privatization of retirement risk is your generation's inheritance, and it's exhausting.</p><p>You probably own a house. You bought it in your late twenties or early thirties, when houses cost three to four times your annual salary instead of ten times. That seems insane now. Your house appreciated 200%, 300%, maybe more. You look at Millennials paying $2,500 for a one-bedroom apartment and you understand, mathematically, why they can't do what you did. You got lucky with timing. Timing is everything. You know this, even if you sometimes forget it.</p><p>If you got caught in 2008—if you bought at the peak, lost your job, and couldn't make the payments—you might still be recovering. Foreclosure. Short sale. Bankruptcy. Credit score cratered. The same banks that sold you predatory loans got bailed out while you lost everything. The injustice of that never stopped burning, even as you rebuilt.</p><p>Your financial psychology is defensive. You're not trying to get rich—you're trying to not be poor. You max out your 401(k) because you don't trust Social Security to exist when you need it. You keep six months of expenses in a savings account earning 0.3% interest because you've learned that emergencies aren't exceptional—they're every other year. You drive your car until it dies because a car payment is a vulnerability.</p><p>Here's the number that defines your generation's situation: when Boomers were your age, they held 21% of national wealth. Gen X holds about 30% now, which sounds better until you realize you're trying to fund your own retirement, pay for your kids' college, and support your aging parents simultaneously. You're the sandwich generation—squeezed from both directions, responsible for everyone, with no safety net except the one you weave yourself.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>The ironic detachment that protected you in your twenties has calcified into something less useful. You're so practiced at not caring that sometimes you actually don't care—and you've lost the ability to tell the difference. The cynicism that started as self-defense became a personality, and now you can't take it off.</p><p>You're skeptical of enthusiasm to the point of paralysis. Everything has to be hedged, qualified, wrapped in air quotes. You can't just like something—you have to like it ironically. You can't advocate for something without distancing yourself from the advocacy. This makes you bad at organizing, bad at movement-building, bad at the kind of collective action that actually changes things. You can critique power brilliantly, but you can't build counter-power because building requires earnestness.</p><p>Your self-reliance has a shadow side: you dismiss people who need help. You figured it out without a safety net, so why can't everyone else? But the game got harder while you weren't paying attention. A twenty-five-year-old today faces worse economics than you did at twenty-five—higher housing costs, more debt, fewer benefits, less stability. When you tell them to 'just work harder,' you're not being realistic. You're being nostalgic for conditions that no longer exist.</p><p>You don't ask for help, and this costs you. Therapy was stigmatized when you were young. 'Deal with it' was advice, not a criticism. You internalized that. You suffer in silence because silence feels like strength, even when it's just isolation. The Millennials and Gen Z kids who talk openly about their mental health aren't weak—they're doing something you never learned to do.</p><p>You've accepted too much as unchangeable. You watched institutions fail and concluded that institutions always fail, so why bother reforming them? This pragmatic nihilism means you often don't show up when showing up matters. Gen X voter turnout lags. Gen X civic engagement lags. You're underrepresented in politics, in activism, in collective organizing. You checked out so thoroughly that you forgot checking back in was an option.</p><p>And here's the hardest one: you became what you mocked. The Boomers you rolled your eyes at? You sound like them now—complaining about younger generations, dismissing their concerns, insisting things were harder in your day. The irony would be delicious if it weren't so depressing. You became the establishment by accident, while still feeling like the outsider. That disconnect is your generation's particular form of self-deception.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1993-2003):</strong> You graduated into the early '90s recession, took whatever job you could get, and told yourself it was temporary. By your mid-twenties, the economy recovered, the dot-com boom started, and suddenly everyone was talking about IPOs and stock options. You either caught the wave or watched it from shore. Either way, you learned the first lesson: booms end. You job-hopped more than your parents approved of—three companies in five years wasn't disloyalty, it was survival. You didn't expect a pension. You barely expected a career. You just kept moving.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2003-2013):</strong> You turned thirty right after 9/11 rewrote the rules. The 2000s were supposed to be your settling-down decade—marriage, kids, house, stability. Some of you got there. Some of you got halfway there before 2008 happened. The crash tested whatever you'd built. You lost a job, or a house, or half your retirement savings, or all three. You rebuilt, because that's what Gen X does. Nobody came to save you. You didn't expect them to.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2013-2023):</strong> You became invisible. Marketers targeted Millennials. Politicians courted Boomers. You kept showing up—to work, to your kids' soccer games, to the mortgage payment. This was your peak earning decade, statistically, though 'peak' felt more like 'plateau.' You managed people half your age who confused you with their Slack etiquette and their need for constant feedback. You were supposed to be running things by now. In some ways you are. In some ways you're still waiting for the adults to show up.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2023-2033):</strong> You're here now, or you're entering soon. This is the decade of reckoning. Your kids are leaving or gone. Your parents are aging, declining, dying. You're sandwiched between responsibilities you didn't fully anticipate—financially supporting adult children who can't afford rent, emotionally supporting parents who can't live alone, professionally supporting a team while wondering if you're about to be 'transitioned out.' The math on retirement is getting clearer, and the answer is probably 'not yet.' You're tired in ways that don't fully recover anymore. This is the decade where you either accept the life you've built or blow it up while you still can.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2033+):</strong> Retirement will be different for you than it was for your parents. They had pensions. You have a 401(k) and hope. You'll probably work longer than you planned—not because you love working, but because Social Security won't be enough, healthcare costs keep rising, and the math doesn't work otherwise. You'll watch younger generations struggle with problems you tried to warn them about, and they'll ignore you the same way you ignored warnings from generations before. You'll become the nostalgic one, telling stories about life before the internet that sound like science fiction. And somewhere in there, if you're lucky, you'll find peace with what you built—the career, the family, the survival. You made it through. That's more than nothing.</p>"

You're part of the 65 million Americans classified as Gen X—the smallest of the major generations, the demographic valley between the massive Boomer and Millennial peaks. You're the middle child of American generations, and you have the classic middle-child traits: self-sufficient, overlooked, slightly resentful about both.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> They got the feast; you got the cleanup. Boomers entered adulthood during the greatest economic expansion in American history. Houses cost two years' salary. College was nearly free. Jobs came with pensions. They had the luxury of idealism—protesting Vietnam, believing they could change the world—because the world was still giving them things. You entered adulthood as those things disappeared. The pensions became 401(k)s. The cheap houses became unaffordable. The secure jobs became 'restructured.' You're not bitter. (You're a little bitter.)</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> You're cousins in economic suffering, but with different temperaments. Millennials entered a broken economy and demanded it be fixed. You entered a breaking economy and shrugged. They organize; you adapt. They believe the system can be reformed; you believe the system is what it is. They're angry about being cheated out of something; you never expected much in the first place. This isn't pessimism—it's just the difference between losing something you had and never having it at all.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You might as well be from different planets. They've never known a world without the internet, without smartphones, without being constantly connected and surveilled. You remember life before all of it. They think you're old and out of touch. You think they're anxious and oversharing. You're probably both right. But here's the thing: they're dealing with worse mental health outcomes than any generation before, and their nihilism isn't ironic—it's earnest. That should worry everyone.</p><p>Your life expectancy is 77-79 years, slightly better than Millennials (who are dying of 'deaths of despair' at higher rates) and slightly worse than Boomers (who got better childhood nutrition and cheaper healthcare). You're pragmatic about health the same way you're pragmatic about everything—you know you should exercise and eat vegetables, and you mostly do it without turning it into a podcast.</p><p>Financially, Gen X controls about 30% of US wealth—more than Millennials at the same age, less than Boomers. You're the sandwich generation: supporting aging parents who can't afford long-term care, supporting adult children who can't afford rent, supporting yourself with whatever's left. Your retirement depends entirely on what you managed to save. No pension. No guaranteed Social Security. Just you and a portfolio and the hope that the market doesn't crash at the wrong time.</p><p>Your generation's legacy is complicated. You didn't change the world—you survived it. You maintained institutions through sheer stubborn endurance, even institutions you didn't believe in. You kept showing up. Whether that's heroic or complicit depends on who's asking. But you're still here, which is more than some generations can say.</p>"
