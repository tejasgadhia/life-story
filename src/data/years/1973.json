      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1973-1985</h2><p>The smell of vinyl car seats in summer. The taste of Tang mixed wrong—too sweet, too orange, stirred with a long-handled spoon in a Tupperware pitcher. The scratch of shag carpet against knees while playing with Hot Wheels on the orange-and-brown floor. Growing up in the early 1970s had textures that don't exist anymore.</p><p>Children were born into harvest gold and avocado green. Every kitchen had those colors. Every living room had wood paneling and a console TV the size of a coffin. Parents smoked Winstons or Virginia Slims inside the house, inside the car, inside restaurants where the 'non-smoking section' was three feet away from the smoking section. The whole world smelled like secondhand smoke and Aqua Net.</p><p>At four, Star Wars was watched in packed theaters, and brains rewired themselves forever. Action figures were begged for—Luke, Han, Chewie—and parents paid $2.49 each, not knowing those same figures would sell for thousands someday. Death Stars were built out of cardboard boxes. Lightsaber sounds were made with mouths that are still remembered exactly how to make.</p><p>Toys could kill, and safety wasn't a priority. Lawn darts with actual metal spikes. Clackers that shattered and sent acrylic shrapnel everywhere. The Fisher-Price record player fingers could be pinched in. Big Wheels that launched children into traffic. Stretch Armstrong filled with corn syrup that dogs would eat if left out. They survived because luck is real.</p><p>TV dinners were eaten in compartmentalized aluminum trays—the Salisbury steak with its mysterious gravy, the apple cobbler that burned tongues, the mashed potatoes with that thin skin on top. Hamburger Helper for dinner. Pop-Tarts for breakfast (no toasting—straight from the foil). Kool-Aid by the gallon, red #40 staining upper lips. Parents gave Tang because astronauts drank it, and astronauts were basically gods.</p><p>At twelve, the Challenger disaster imprinted itself on memory—teachers had wheeled in TVs to watch history, and instead tragedy was watched unfold at 11:39 AM on a Tuesday.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Gen X Generation</h2><p>Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. The forgotten middle child. The latchkey generation. The slackers. They've been called everything except what they actually are: the generation that watched the American Dream curdle and decided to laugh about it instead of cry.</p><p>This generation is <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> strong, sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials. They're the demographic trough, the marketing afterthought, the generation that advertisers couldn't quite figure out because they saw through every sales pitch. They'd been advertised to since birth—Saturday morning commercials for Cap'n Crunch, G.I. Joe, and breakfast cereals with mascots. By the time they were teenagers, they were fluent in manipulation and immune to sincerity.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">They were one when Nixon resigned.</span> Divorce shaped them more than any political event. By 1980, half of all marriages ended in divorce, and they watched it happen in their house or their friends' houses. Parents told them it wasn't their fault—the first generation to hear that specific therapy-speak—and they believed them, mostly. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span> They learned to be self-sufficient because they had to be. Nobody was coming to save them. Not their parents, not the government, not the corporations that would lay off their dad on a Tuesday.</p><p>Their defining moment came at twelve: the Challenger exploded on live television. January 28, 1986. Teachers had wheeled in TV carts because Christa McAuliffe was making history—a teacher in space. Instead, they watched seven people die at 11:39 AM on a Tuesday. The O-ring failed. The institution failed. Every adult in the room went silent in a way that scared them more than the explosion itself. They learned that even rockets could fail, even heroes could die, even NASA could get it catastrophically wrong.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, they were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> The defining Gen X mood is ironic detachment—not because they don't care, but because caring too much seemed dangerous. They watched Boomers' idealism turn into yuppie materialism. They watched flower children become corporate raiders. They learned that if they invest too much in anything, it will let them down, so they hedged everything with sarcasm. Cynicism as self-defense. Whatever as philosophy.</p><p>They're the last generation that can remember life before the internet, before cell phones, before GPS, before everything was tracked and recorded. They know what genuine privacy felt like. They know what it was like to disappear for a few hours. <span class=\"hero-callout\">They can still entertain themselves without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year 1973, The Exorcist made audiences physically vomit in theaters. The Godfather swept the Oscars. Pink Floyd released The Dark Side of the Moon—an album that wouldn't be appreciated until college, when it would be played synced to The Wizard of Oz at 2 AM and sworn it was intentional. American Graffiti made everyone nostalgic for a 1962 that was ten years ago and already felt like ancient history. Nostalgia was getting faster.</p><p>Parents' turntables played Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and The Carpenters singing about rainy days and Mondays. Jim Croce died in a plane crash four months after they were born—they'd grow up hearing 'Time in a Bottle' at weddings without knowing the guy was already gone. Classic rock was their lullaby music before it was classic.</p><p>At four, Star Wars happened, and nothing was ever the same. They weren't just watching a movie—they were being inducted into a religion. Action figures were collected: Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca (whose name they couldn't pronounce), Darth Vader. They had the lunchbox. The bedsheets. The Underoos. When Empire came out at seven, and Vader said 'I am your father,' minds broke open. The villain was the hero's dad? Stories could do that?</p><p>Saturday mornings were Schoolhouse Rock ('Conjunction Junction'), Super Friends, Scooby-Doo, and The Smurfs. Froot Loops and Cap'n Crunch were eaten in front of the TV while commercials taught them to want things they didn't need—Stretch Armstrong, Evel Knievel stunt cycles, Easy-Bake Ovens that could actually burn them. By eight, the preamble to the Constitution could be recited because of a cartoon. Nobody planned that. It just happened.</p><p>At eleven, MTV launched, and culture was watched rewire in real time. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' premiere was seen. Madonna rolling around on the floor at the VMAs singing 'Like a Virgin' was watched while parents asked what the hell was happening to America. Duran Duran, Cyndi Lauper, Prince in that purple everything were absorbed. Music became visual, and they were fluent before adults understood the grammar.</p><p>High school was John Hughes. The Breakfast Club at twelve—they knew which character they were and who they wanted to be. Sixteen Candles at eleven, Ferris Bueller's Day Off at thirteen, Pretty in Pink at thirteen. Hughes understood suburban teenage loneliness better than guidance counselors. Molly Ringwald was their generation's mascot before anyone called them a generation.</p><p>Then grunge arrived to kill everything that came before. They were eighteen when Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' dropped, and suddenly all that ironic detachment they'd been practicing had a soundtrack. Kurt Cobain in that moth-eaten cardigan, screaming about teen spirit like he was talking directly to them. He probably was. Three years later, he was dead, and they learned that some alienation couldn't be survived.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year 1973, Motorola engineer Martin Cooper made the first handheld cell phone call—a brick-sized prototype that cost $3,995 and wouldn't reach consumers for another decade. Ethernet was invented at Xerox PARC. The pocket calculator dropped below $100 for the first time, and dads probably bought one to balance checkbooks. Technology in 1973 was mainframes and punch cards, rotary phones and typewriters. The future existed only in labs.</p><p>First video games were probably Pong—that hypnotic bounce, those beeps, that moment when it was realized a television could be interactive. It was played at arcades or on Atari 2600s at friends' houses. Space Invaders arrived when they were five. Quarters were pumped into it at the mall, at Pizza Hut, at any establishment that had one of those mysterious cabinet machines. Pac-Man at seven. Donkey Kong at eight. Hand-eye coordination was developed that would prove directly transferable to exactly nothing in adult life, and indirectly transferable to everything.</p><p>At eleven, the Macintosh launched with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial—that hammer through the screen, Big Brother shattered, the promise that personal computers would set them free. They were too young to buy one, but they knew something had shifted. At thirteen, Commodore 64s or Apple IIes were gotten in dens. Oregon Trail was played and dysentery deaths occurred. BASIC programming was learned from library books because there was no other way to learn. LOAD\"*\",8,1 was typed and forever waited for something to happen.</p><p>College experience involved card catalogs and the Dewey Decimal System. Papers were written on typewriters, or if lucky, word processors that looked like typewriters had a baby with microwaves. Research meant microfiche—that particular whirring sound, the eye strain, the neck ache from hunching over those machines in library basements. If something needed to be known, it was looked up. In a book. Made of paper. This took time, and that time taught patience they'd later forget they had.</p><p>At eighteen, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, but it wouldn't be touched until their twenties. Email arrived at workplaces in their mid-twenties—they thought it was a fad. First cell phones were gotten around twenty-five: Nokia or Motorola bricks that did nothing but make staticky calls, and payment was by the minute, so they didn't. The internet crept into their life on dial-up modems, that screech-and-handshake sound, ten minutes for a single image to load while nobody in the house could use the phone.</p><p>They're the bridge generation. They remember the before times—rotary phones, encyclopedias, getting genuinely lost because MapQuest hadn't printed directions—but they've spent most of their adult life adapting to the after times. They're fluent in both worlds. They can read a paper map and navigate by GPS. They can write a letter and send a text. They understand what was lost and what was gained, which makes them either wise or nostalgic, depending on how the story is told.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were they when they first understood the world could fail? That's the Gen X question, and they've had to answer it more times than any generation should.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">They were one when Nixon resigned.</span> They were born into Watergate. The break-in happened the year before; the hearings dominated the summer they arrived. By the time they were one, Nixon was resigning on live television—parents watching as a president became a criminal in real time. 'I am not a crook' was a punchline before they could talk. They grew up knowing, instinctively, that leaders lie. It wasn't cynicism. It was just observation.</p><p>At six months old, the last American combat troops left Vietnam. The helicopters lifting off from embassy rooftops, the fall of Saigon—they don't remember it, but it shaped everything around them. The veterans came home to silence. The country didn't want to talk about it. They absorbed that lesson: some failures are too big to discuss, so we just... don't.</p><p>At six, the oil crisis hit families. Gas lines. Odd-even rationing. Dads cursing OPEC in station wagons. The post-war abundance their parents had grown up with—the cheap gas, the big cars, the infinite American road—was over. They learned early that resources were finite, that other countries could hurt us, that the future wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>At seven, the Iranian hostage crisis started. They were too young to understand the geopolitics, but they understood the flag-draped anger, the yellow ribbons, the <span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days of impotence that Jimmy Carter couldn't fix. At eight, John Lennon was shot outside his apartment building in New York. They didn't fully understand who he was yet, but they understood the adults were devastated—that someone could just be killed, randomly, for nothing.</p><p>At twelve, the Challenger disaster became their generation's shared trauma—the shuttle broke apart while classrooms across America watched live.</p><p>At sixteen, the Berlin Wall fell. Crowds with sledgehammers, champagne, tears of joy, and something their parents called 'the end of history' were watched. At eighteen, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the Cold War—that nuclear sword that had hung over their entire childhood—just disappeared. No apocalypse. No World War III. Just a quiet implosion and a 'peace dividend' that would never arrive.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, they were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> They were at work, or just getting there. Someone said a plane hit the World Trade Center, and the thought was small plane, accident. Then the second plane hit, and they understood. They watched the towers fall on televisions in offices or bars or strangers' living rooms. They knew, instantly, that everything before that moment was 'before' and everything after was 'after.' The wars that followed—Afghanistan, Iraq, the endless War on Terror—they were old enough to know they were wrong but young enough to feel powerless to stop them.</p><p>At thirty-five, the financial system collapsed. Mortgages existed by then, 401(k)s, something to lose. Half of it was watched evaporate. The banks got bailed out. They didn't. The lesson, again: the system protects itself, not them.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The job market of 1995 offered entry-level positions paying $22,000 and requiring suits that couldn't be afforded. The economy was recovering from the early '90s recession, but 'recovering' meant entry-level jobs paid $22,000 and required a suit. Suits were bought at JCPenney with credit cards. It was called an investment. That's what they were told to call it.</p><p>Parents' career path: get hired, work forty years at the same company, get a pension, get a gold watch, retire. Gen X path: get hired, watch the company 'restructure,' get laid off, find another job, get 'rightsized,' find another job, abandon any illusion that loyalty would be rewarded. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> The corporation didn't love their dad, and it definitely doesn't love them.</p><p>At twenty-seven, the dot-com boom happened. Twenty-four-year-olds in cargo shorts becoming millionaires on business plans written on cocktail napkins were watched. Pets.com. Webvan. Companies with no revenue and infinite valuations. Maybe they caught the wave—got hired at a startup, got stock options, cashed out before the crash. More likely, they watched from the sidelines of stable-ish corporate jobs and wondered if they'd made a mistake. Then 2000 happened, the bubble burst, and they felt either vindicated or robbed, depending on which side they'd been on. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span></p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived.</span> By 2008, they were mid-career. Titles existed, maybe some direct reports, definitely mortgages. Then Lehman Brothers collapsed, and suddenly they were expensive. 'Experienced' became a liability. The highest salaries were laid off first—them, or people just like them. The same HR department that praised performance reviews gave cardboard boxes and security escorts. They landed on their feet, probably. Gen X always lands on its feet. But the lesson stuck: they're always one quarter away from being a line item someone decides to cut.</p><p>Gen X invented work-life balance as a concept because they watched their Boomer parents sacrifice everything for companies that laid them off anyway. They saw their dad give his life to a corporation that discarded him at fifty-five. They decided not to play that game. They're not disloyal—they're rational. Why would they love something that will never love them back?</p><p>Now they're in leadership positions, managing Millennials who want purpose and Gen Z who want flexibility. They give them what they can because they remember what it was like to be dismissed by people who didn't understand. But quietly, they wonder: are they naive or enlightened? Did Gen X accept too much? Did younger generations learn from their mistakes, or are they making new ones?</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Waiting by the phone: not the phone in pockets—the phone attached to the wall with the curly cord that stretched into hall closets for privacy. They sat there, willing it to ring, knowing that if calls came while moms were talking to Aunt Linda, they'd never know. Call waiting was a luxury. Caller ID was science fiction. Rejection happened without preview, without buffer, without the ability to screenshot it to group chats.</p><p>Gen X asked people out in person. In person. With voices, faces, visible terror. Or notes were passed in class—'Do you like me? Check yes or no'—and they were watched read it from across the room. The agony of waiting for that folded paper to come back. The crushing disappointment or the euphoric relief. No emojis. No 'lol.' Just handwriting and eye contact.</p><p>They dated before the algorithm. They met people at parties, at bars, through mutual friends, at work (back when that was still acceptable). Social media couldn't be previewed first. They couldn't Google them. They showed up to dates knowing nothing except what they'd told them, which might be true or might be complete fiction. Instincts were developed. Body language was read. They learned to trust their gut because there was no other data source.</p><p>This generation invented 'friends with benefits' and 'it's complicated' as relationship categories. Boomers got married at twenty-two. Gen X waited until their late twenties or early thirties—if they got married at all. Cohabitation without marriage became normal. Living together to 'see if it works' made sense to them in ways that scandalized their grandparents. Half of them divorced anyway, but at least they did it without Instagram commentary.</p><p>They know how to be alone. Genuinely, completely alone—unreachable, untrackable, off the grid. They could leave their house without a phone and just... exist somewhere, with no one knowing where they were. This felt normal then. It feels like a superpower now. They can sit in silence without reaching for a screen. They can be bored without needing to fix it. These are skills younger generations will have to consciously develop, if they develop them at all.</p><p>Their friendships are deep but narrow. They didn't accumulate 800 Facebook friends—they maintained maybe a dozen real relationships across their life. Their best friend from high school is still their best friend. Their college roommate knows things about them that their spouse doesn't. They're suspicious of anyone who claims to have hundreds of close connections, because they know the math doesn't work. Intimacy requires time, and time is finite.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during their prime earning years.</span> They've lived through four economic crises as adults, and they're expecting the fifth. This isn't pessimism—it's pattern recognition. Early '90s recession. Dot-com bust. 2008 collapse. COVID crash. Every decade brings a new way for the floor to fall out, and every time they're told it was unforeseeable. The market dropped <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span> in 2008. Mortgage rates hit <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span> in the early '80s. They've stopped believing that crashes are unforeseeable. The floor is made of paper. Act accordingly.</p><p>Their parents got pensions. They got 401(k)s. This was sold as freedom—control their own retirement!—but in practice it meant they've spent thirty years becoming amateur mutual fund managers, reading Morningstar ratings, trying to figure out if they should be 70/30 stocks-to-bonds or 60/40, while praying the market doesn't crater the year they plan to retire. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> The privatization of retirement risk is their generation's inheritance, and it's exhausting.</p><p>They probably own a house. They bought it in their late twenties or early thirties, when houses cost three to four times their annual salary instead of ten times. That seems insane now. Their house appreciated 200%, 300%, maybe more. They look at Millennials paying $2,500 for a one-bedroom apartment and they understand, mathematically, why they can't do what they did. They got lucky with timing. Timing is everything. They know this, even if they sometimes forget it.</p><p>If they got caught in 2008—if they bought at the peak, lost their job, and couldn't make the payments—they might still be recovering. Foreclosure. Short sale. Bankruptcy. Credit score cratered. The same banks that sold them predatory loans got bailed out while they lost everything. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> The injustice of that never stopped burning, even as they rebuilt.</p><p>Gen X financial psychology is defensive. They're not trying to get rich—they're trying to not be poor. They max out their 401(k) because they don't trust Social Security to exist when they need it. They keep six months of expenses in savings accounts earning 0.3% interest because they've learned that emergencies aren't exceptional—they're every other year. They drive their car until it dies because a car payment is a vulnerability.</p><p>They're the sandwich generation—squeezed from both directions, responsible for everyone, with no safety net except the one they weave themselves. Aging parents who need care, adult children who can't afford to launch, and their own retirement to fund simultaneously. The math doesn't quite work, but they make it work anyway.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's ironic detachment that protected them in their twenties has calcified into something less useful. They're so practiced at not caring that sometimes they actually don't care—and they've lost the ability to tell the difference. The cynicism that started as self-defense became a personality, and now they can't take it off.</p><p>They're skeptical of enthusiasm to the point of paralysis. Everything has to be hedged, qualified, wrapped in air quotes. They can't just like something—they have to like it ironically. They can't advocate for something without distancing themselves from the advocacy. This makes them bad at organizing, bad at movement-building, bad at the kind of collective action that actually changes things. They can critique power brilliantly, but they can't build counter-power because building requires earnestness.</p><p>Their self-reliance has a shadow side: they dismiss people who need help. They figured it out without a safety net, so why can't everyone else? But the game got harder while they weren't paying attention. A twenty-five-year-old today faces different conditions than they did at twenty-five. When they tell them to 'just work harder,' they might be nostalgic for circumstances that have shifted.</p><p>They don't ask for help, and this costs them. Therapy was stigmatized when they were young. 'Deal with it' was advice, not a criticism. They internalized that. They suffer in silence because silence feels like strength, even when it's just isolation. The Millennials and Gen Z kids who talk openly about their mental health aren't weak—they're doing something Gen X never learned to do.</p><p>They've accepted too much as unchangeable. They watched institutions fail and concluded that institutions always fail, so why bother reforming them? This pragmatic nihilism means they often don't show up when showing up matters. Gen X voter turnout lags. Gen X civic engagement lags. They're underrepresented in politics, in activism, in collective organizing. They checked out so thoroughly that they forgot checking back in was an option.</p><p>And here's the hardest one: they became what they mocked. The Boomers they rolled their eyes at? They sound like them now—complaining about younger generations, dismissing their concerns, insisting things were harder in their day. The irony would be delicious if it weren't so depressing. They became the establishment by accident, while still feeling like the outsider. That disconnect is their generation's particular form of self-deception.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Their 20s (1993-2003):</strong> They graduated into the early '90s recession, took whatever job they could get, and told themselves it was temporary. By their mid-twenties, the economy recovered, the dot-com boom started, and suddenly everyone was talking about IPOs and stock options. They either caught the wave or watched it from shore. Either way, they learned the first lesson: booms end. They job-hopped more than their parents approved of—three companies in five years wasn't disloyalty, it was survival. They didn't expect a pension. They barely expected a career. They just kept moving.</p><p><strong>Their 30s (2003-2013):</strong> They turned thirty right after 9/11 rewrote the rules. The 2000s were supposed to be their settling-down decade—marriage, kids, house, stability. Some of them got there. Some of them got halfway there before 2008 happened. The crash tested whatever they'd built. They lost a job, or a house, or half their retirement savings, or all three. They rebuilt, because that's what Gen X does. Nobody came to save them. They didn't expect them to.</p><p><strong>Their 40s (2013-2023):</strong> They became invisible. Marketers targeted Millennials. Politicians courted Boomers. They kept showing up—to work, to their kids' soccer games, to mortgage payments. This was their peak earning decade, statistically, though 'peak' felt more like 'plateau.' They managed people half their age who confused them with their Slack etiquette and their need for constant feedback. They were supposed to be running things by now. In some ways they are. In some ways they're still waiting for the adults to show up.</p><p><strong>Their 50s (2023-2033):</strong> They're here now, or they're entering soon. This is the decade of reckoning. Their kids are leaving or gone. Their parents are aging, declining, dying. They're sandwiched between responsibilities they didn't fully anticipate—financially supporting adult children who can't afford rent, emotionally supporting parents who can't live alone, professionally supporting teams while wondering if they're about to be 'transitioned out.' The math on retirement is getting clearer, and the answer is probably 'not yet.' They're tired in ways that don't fully recover anymore. This is the decade where they either accept the life they've built or blow it up while they still can.</p><p><strong>Their 60s and beyond (2033+):</strong> Retirement will be different for them than it was for their parents. Their parents had pensions. They have 401(k)s and hope. They'll probably work longer than they planned—not because they love working, but because Social Security won't be enough, healthcare costs keep rising, and the math doesn't work otherwise. They'll watch younger generations struggle with problems they tried to warn them about, and they'll ignore them the same way Gen X ignored warnings from generations before. They'll become the nostalgic one, telling stories about life before the internet that sound like science fiction. And somewhere in there, if they're lucky, they'll find peace with what they built—the career, the family, the survival. They made it through. That's more than nothing.</p>"

Part of roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Gen Xers, sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> Boomers got the feast; Gen X got the cleanup. Boomers entered adulthood during the greatest economic expansion in American history. College was nearly free. Jobs came with pensions. They had the luxury of idealism—protesting Vietnam, believing they could change the world—because the world was still giving them things. Gen X entered adulthood as those things disappeared. The pensions became 401(k)s. The secure jobs became 'restructured.' Gen X isn't bitter. (They're a little bitter.)</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> They're cousins in economic suffering, but with different temperaments. Millennials entered a broken economy and demanded it be fixed. Gen X entered a breaking economy and shrugged. Millennials organize; Gen X adapts. Millennials believe the system can be reformed; Gen X believes the system is what it is. Millennials are angry about being cheated out of something; Gen X never expected much in the first place. This isn't pessimism—it's just the difference between losing something once held and never having it at all.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They might as well be from different planets. Gen Z has never known a world without the internet, without smartphones, without being constantly connected and surveilled. Gen X remembers life before all of it. Gen Z thinks Gen X is old and out of touch. Gen X thinks Gen Z is anxious and oversharing. They're probably both right. But here's the thing: Gen Z is dealing with worse mental health outcomes than any generation before, and their nihilism isn't ironic—it's earnest.
