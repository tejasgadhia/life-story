      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1987-1999</h2><p>You were born the year the stock market crashed on Black Monday, losing 22% of its value in a single October day. Your parents probably don't remember your birth without also remembering their portfolios evaporating. You arrived alongside the first Simpsons short on The Tracey Ullman Show—a fitting omen for a generation raised on animated dysfunction.</p><p>Your earliest memories likely include the fall of the Berlin Wall. You were two, which means you don't actually remember it, but your parents watched it live on TV while you crawled around oblivious. The Cold War ended before you could spell. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were four. You grew up in a world that adults kept insisting was safer now, even as it clearly wasn't.</p><p>Your childhood was the last purely analog experience. You had cassette tapes before CDs. You played outside because there was nothing else to do. If you wanted to call a friend, you memorized their phone number and hoped their mom wasn't expecting a call. The internet existed somewhere, but not in your house, not yet.</p><p>You were seven when Princess Diana died. Nine when Columbine happened. Fourteen during 9/11. These events didn't feel like history—they felt like the background hum of growing up. Adults tried to shield you from the news while the news played constantly on every screen in every room.</p><p>Technology crept in gradually. Your family probably got a computer sometime around 1995. It had a CRT monitor, ran Windows 95, and made that modem screech when connecting to AOL. You learned to type in computer class. You played Oregon Trail until everyone died of dysentery. The future arrived slowly, then all at once.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996. You're in the earlier cohort—sometimes called 'elder Millennials' or 'geriatric Millennials,' which is a term designed to make you feel ancient at thirty-seven. Your generation numbers roughly 72 million in the US, the largest generation until Gen Z started outpacing you.</p><p>The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. You were fourteen. You were old enough to understand what was happening, young enough for it to rewire your entire sense of safety. Before that day, airports were places your family waited at the gate. After, everything became threat assessment.</p><p>Your generation entered adulthood just in time for the 2008 financial crisis to destroy the job market. You graduated into a recession, watched housing prices become absurd while wages stagnated, and somehow got blamed for the decline of everything from napkins to department stores. You didn't kill those industries—you couldn't afford them.</p><p>You're sandwiched between Gen X, who caught the tail end of the good times, and Gen Z, who never expected good times in the first place. You're the generation that still believed the American Dream was possible, then watched it become a punchline. That kind of disappointment shapes a person.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year The Princess Bride became a cult classic and Dirty Dancing made Patrick Swayze the subject of a million bedroom posters. Three Men and a Baby was the highest-grossing film—a simpler time when 'men doing childcare' was considered comedy gold. U2 released The Joshua Tree and became the biggest band in the world.</p><p>Your birth year gave the world The Simpsons (as shorts), Full House, and Married... with Children. Television was learning that families could be dysfunctional, sarcastic, or both. These shows would syndicate endlessly, becoming the background noise of your entire childhood.</p><p>Musically, 1987 was the bridge between hair metal and whatever came next. Guns N' Roses released Appetite for Destruction. Michael Jackson's Bad competed with Whitney Houston. George Michael was everywhere. The music you were born into was glossy, excessive, and deeply convinced that synthesizers improved everything.</p><p>Your childhood was peak Nickelodeon—Doug, Rugrats, The Secret World of Alex Mack. Your middle school years belonged to the late '90s explosion: boy bands, Britney, Total Request Live counting down while you did homework. By high school, emo was happening, Dashboard Confessional was emotional, and everyone's MySpace profile was a carefully curated cry for help.</p><p>The pop culture of your youth was pre-streaming, pre-algorithm, pre-skip. You watched commercials. You waited a week between episodes. You taped things on VHS and hoped nobody recorded over them. Delayed gratification wasn't a choice—it was the only option.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the GIF was invented. That single-frame format would eventually dominate how you communicate with coworkers, but in 1987 it was just a way to make images load faster on CompuServe. The internet existed, but barely—60,000 computers connected to a network nobody outside universities had heard of.</p><p>You were eight when Windows 95 launched, complete with the Rolling Stones soundtrack and a commercial that made clicking 'Start' seem revolutionary. You were eleven when Google went live, still lowercase, still promising not to be evil. Thirteen when Napster let you download music for free and taught an entire generation that digital content wanted to be shared.</p><p>You were fourteen when the iPod arrived. Sixteen when MySpace became your first social network. Seventeen when Facebook opened to high schools. Eighteen when YouTube launched. Twenty when the iPhone changed everything. You didn't grow up with smartphones—you watched them colonize daily life in real-time.</p><p>This makes you the last generation to remember existence before the internet was mandatory. You know what boredom feels like. You remember looking things up in encyclopedias. You can navigate with a paper map. You learned cursive, then watched it become obsolete.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is complicated. You're fluent in digital, but you remember analog. You can troubleshoot your parents' phones and explain TikTok to confused aunts. You're old enough to remember when screens didn't follow you everywhere, young enough that life without them feels unimaginable now.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were six months old when Reagan stood at the Berlin Wall and demanded Gorbachev tear it down. You don't remember it, but the Cold War defined your parents' worldview—the fear of nuclear annihilation, the duck-and-cover drills, the us-versus-them certainty. By the time you could talk, it was over. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were four. The existential threat evaporated, replaced by smaller, messier ones.</p><p>You were two when Baby Jessica fell down a well in Texas. The entire country watched her rescue live for fifty-eight hours. It was early reality TV before anyone called it that—America united by a toddler stuck underground and the volunteers digging to save her.</p><p>You were seven when Princess Diana died in a Paris tunnel. The world's collective grief was your first encounter with mass mourning as spectacle. Everyone watched the funeral. Everyone had opinions. You probably didn't understand why adults were so upset about someone they'd never met.</p><p>You were twelve during Columbine. That was the school shooting that became the template—the media coverage, the blame on video games and trench coats, the active shooter drills that followed. School stopped being entirely safe. You practiced hiding in closets and staying quiet.</p><p>You were fourteen during 9/11. You watched the towers fall, probably in a classroom with a teacher who didn't know what to say. The world before that morning became a foreign country you couldn't visit again. The wars that followed lasted longer than anyone predicted. You spent your entire adolescence with American troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>You were twenty-one during the 2008 financial crisis. You graduated—or were about to—into an economy that had just imploded. The recovery was slow, uneven, and never quite reached your generation. You were twenty-six when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. Twenty-nine when Trump won. Thirty-two during COVID. History kept happening, faster and more disorienting each time.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated into the 2008 financial crisis or its immediate aftermath. Entry-level jobs evaporated. Unpaid internships became the only way in. 'Just get your foot in the door' became advice you heard constantly from people who'd never faced a door that locked.</p><p>Your generation invented the 'side hustle' out of necessity, not passion. One job didn't pay enough. Two jobs barely did. You learned to frame exhaustion as 'entrepreneurial spirit' because that's what LinkedIn demanded. You built personal brands because applying for jobs required becoming a product.</p><p>You're the generation that normalized job-hopping, not out of disloyalty but because employers abandoned loyalty first. Pensions disappeared. Annual raises became 'we're tightening budgets' speeches. The social contract between workers and companies was shredded before you even got your first business cards.</p><p>You've worked in offices with exposed brick and 'unlimited PTO' that nobody takes because the culture punishes rest. You've sat through all-hands meetings about company values while watching leadership ignore those values entirely. You've been told you're 'like family' by employers who'd lay you off by email.</p><p>Remote work became normalized during COVID, which was possibly the only silver lining of that catastrophe. You proved productivity doesn't require surveillance. Now employers expect you to be productive everywhere, all the time, your phone always pinging with Slack notifications at 11 PM.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that watched dating become an app. Tinder launched when you were twenty-six. By your late twenties, swiping had replaced meeting people in physical locations. Romance became a sorting algorithm, and you were both operator and product.</p><p>You probably met at least one significant partner online, which your parents find bizarre and your younger cousins find completely ordinary. You're the bridge generation—old enough to remember asking someone out in person, young enough to have normalized doing it through screens.</p><p>You communicate primarily through text, but you remember when calling was the only option. You know the anxiety of three dots appearing and disappearing. You've had fights via message that would have been resolved in sixty seconds face-to-face. You've maintained entire relationships through DMs.</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage longer than any before—not from reluctance but from math. Weddings cost a year's salary. Houses cost a decade's salary. Kids cost everything forever. The relationship milestones your parents hit at twenty-five, you're hitting at thirty-five, if at all.</p><p>You've maintained friendships across time zones because everyone moved—for work, for cheaper rent, for something better than wherever they started. Group chats replaced geographic proximity. You know how to be intimate with people you rarely see in person and distant from people you see every day.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were thirteen when the dot-com bubble burst. Twenty-one during the 2008 financial crisis. Thirty-three during COVID's economic collapse. You've watched the economy crater three times before middle age. Your financial worldview is best described as 'waiting for the next disaster.'</p><p>Your relationship with money is defined by scarcity that never quite ends. You graduated with student loan debt that will follow you into your forties. You watched housing prices double while your wages grew single digits. The financial milestones your parents assumed—house, savings, retirement—became aspirational fiction.</p><p>You save aggressively because you've seen how fast stability disappears. You invest cautiously because you don't trust the stock market, but you don't trust Social Security either, so what's the alternative? You're playing a game you know is rigged because opting out means losing by default.</p><p>You've been lectured about discretionary spending by people who bought houses for the price of your student loans. The generational wealth gap is staggering. Boomers accumulated assets when they were cheap. You're accumulating debt while everything is expensive. The math doesn't work, but you're supposed to make it work anyway.</p><p>Your generation is redefining financial success because the old definitions are unavailable. Success isn't homeownership—it's stable rent in a city where the jobs exist. It's not retirement at sixty-five—it's hoping something survives until you're seventy. It's not building generational wealth—it's not becoming a burden to your kids.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's defining weakness is your belief that everything can be optimized. You track your sleep, your steps, your calories, your screen time, your productivity. You approach existence like a series of inputs to be maximized. The problem is some things can't be hacked, and systemic problems don't respond to personal efficiency.</p><p>You're so skilled at adapting to broken systems that you forget to question whether the systems should exist. You've normalized precarity. You've accepted that healthcare depends on employment, that education requires crushing debt, that retirement is a fantasy for the wealthy. You've learned to cope instead of demanding structural change.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that cost you. You've been trained to be team players, to not make waves, to bring solutions instead of complaints. This makes you exploitable. You'll work unpaid overtime for 'the mission.' You'll accept equity instead of salary. You'll endure abusive workplaces because the alternative is worse.</p><p>You're so steeped in irony that sincerity feels dangerous. You can't just care about something—you have to care about it ironically, or care while acknowledging its flaws, or explain that caring is actually a critique. This makes advocating for yourself feel performative. You hedge everything.</p><p>Your generation is so chronically online that you sometimes mistake digital activity for real-world impact. You can mobilize hashtags but struggle with voter turnout. You can cancel public figures but rarely show up to city council meetings. The performative feels like action. Often, it isn't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (2007-2017):</strong> You graduated into economic collapse. You took jobs you were overqualified for, moved back home or lived with roommates into your late twenties, and delayed every milestone that required money. This was supposed to be your decade of exploration. Instead, it was your decade of survival, of making $35,000 stretch like $60,000, of pretending everything was fine while nothing was.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2017-2027):</strong> You're in this decade now. You're earning more than you did at twenty-five, but expenses have outpaced income. You're watching younger colleagues enter the workforce and older ones exit it, and you're stuck in the middle—too established to start over, too insecure to relax. You're supposed to settle down, but settling feels like surrender. You're building stability on foundations that keep shifting.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2027-2037):</strong> Statistically, this will be your peak earning decade. You'll have more authority, more clarity about what matters, more acceptance of what doesn't. If you have kids, they'll be growing up. If you have parents, they'll be aging, which brings new obligations. You'll be sandwiched between generations, managing everyone's needs while your own get back-burnered. This is the decade where you either commit to the life you've built or tear it down and try something else.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2037-2047):</strong> By now you'll have survived at least four economic crises, likely a couple of pandemics, and countless 'unprecedented events' that seem to happen every few years. You'll be pre-retirement age but unable to retire because the numbers don't work. You'll be mentoring younger workers who don't understand your scars, and you'll catch yourself sounding like the older generations you once dismissed.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2047+):</strong> Retirement, if it happens, won't look like your parents' retirement. It'll involve part-time work, careful budgeting, maybe reliance on children who are struggling themselves. Social Security may or may not exist in a recognizable form. Climate change will have redrawn maps. The world will be unrecognizable from the one you grew up in. You'll tell younger people about life before smartphones, before the internet was everywhere. They won't quite believe you.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.8 million people born in 1987. The entire Millennial generation is about 72 million in the US, which made you the largest generation until Gen Z started catching up in recent years.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more educated, more diverse, and significantly poorer adjusted for age. Gen X entered the workforce when jobs had benefits and staying somewhere for twenty years was rewarded. You entered when companies stopped pretending loyalty went both ways. They got affordable college. You got student loans. They got pensions. You got 401(k)s you can't afford to fund.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the wealth gap is obscene. Boomers controlled about 21% of national wealth when they were your age. Millennials control roughly 7%. Boomers bought houses on single incomes. You're priced out on dual incomes. Boomers retired with pensions and Social Security. You're hoping both still exist when you're seventy.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're similar but slightly less nihilistic. You remember when things seemed like they might work out. Gen Z doesn't have that memory. You believed the system could be fixed. Gen Z knows it's broken and is building workarounds. You adapted to smartphones. They were born fluent in them. You're the last generation to remember the before times.</p><p>Your life expectancy is 78-80 years, potentially lower than previous generations due to rising 'deaths of despair'—suicide, overdoses, alcohol-related mortality. Your generation has worse mental health outcomes than any before. You're more anxious, more depressed, more medicated. The world you inherited is harder and lonelier than the one that was promised.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more educated, and more attuned to systemic injustice than any generation before. You've normalized therapy and destigmatized struggling. You've pushed for equity in ways your parents' generation didn't prioritize. You've made the world more inclusive even as it's become less affordable. That counts for something.</p>"
