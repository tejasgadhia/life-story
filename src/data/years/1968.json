      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1968-1980</h2><p>The smell of Bactine on scraped knees. The crunch of orange shag carpet under bare feet. The static shock of the wood-paneled TV set when you got too close. Your childhood had a tactile roughness that modern kids will never experience—everything was corduroy and concrete, splinters and sunburns, freedom and benign neglect.</p><p>At five, you were watching Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which had just started the year you were born. Fred Rogers spoke directly to you, told you that you were special, that he liked you just the way you were. This was radical in 1973. You believed him because no one else was saying it. Sesame Street taught you letters with Oscar's grouchiness and Big Bird's innocent questions. The Electric Company made reading cool with Morgan Freeman spelling words like 'H-E-Y.'</p><p>Your toys were indestructible in ways that would horrify today's safety regulators. Hot Wheels—they debuted the year you were born—with that satisfying click on the orange track. Evel Knievel stunt cycles that actually launched. Slip 'N Slides that were basically lawsuits waiting to happen. Lawn darts. Actual metal lawn darts that your parents threw while drinking Tab cola. Nobody wore helmets. Nobody wore seatbelts. Nobody cared.</p><p>You were a latchkey kid before the term existed. Key around your neck, letting yourself in after school, heating up Swanson TV dinners while your parents worked. You watched Brady Bunch reruns, Happy Days, and Gilligan's Island—all alone, in an empty house, teaching yourself that independence wasn't a choice. It was the only option.</p><p>At nine, you watched Nixon resign on that same wood-paneled TV. You didn't understand Watergate, but you understood that adults lied, that presidents could be criminals, that authority was not to be trusted. This lesson sank deep. Your Boomer siblings believed in institutions. You learned to be skeptical before you learned long division.</p><p>At eleven, Star Wars exploded into your life. May 1977. You saw it at least five times in theaters—there was no other way to see it again. Luke Skywalker was your age, fighting evil, escaping his desert planet. You were escaping too, even if your desert was just the suburbs and the evil was just boredom and divorce and a vague sense that the adults had no idea what they were doing.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Generation X</h2><p>Generation X. The name came from a Douglas Coupland novel in 1991, which tells you everything about how seriously marketers took you: they didn't even bother to name you until you were already in your twenties. You were the 'slacker' generation, the 'whatever' generation, the demographic afterthought between the massive Boomer wave and the even more massive Millennial tsunami.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were six when Nixon resigned.</span> Eight when Saigon fell. Thirteen when Americans were held hostage in Iran. Your formative political memories are failure, scandal, and impotence. While Boomers believed they could change the world, you learned to expect disappointment. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Trust nothing. Question everything.</span> This wasn't cynicism—it was pattern recognition. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span></p><p>Your generation spans 1965 to 1980—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Americans. You're smaller than the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers, smaller than the <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials, sandwiched between generations that get all the attention while you quietly keep the world running. The forgotten middle child of American demographics.</p><p>The defining Gen X characteristic is self-reliance. Not by choice—by necessity. You raised yourselves while your parents were getting divorced, getting remarried, working two jobs, finding themselves. The divorce rate doubled during your childhood. Half your friends came from 'broken homes.' You learned that families could shatter and life continued anyway.</p><p>You invented ironic detachment as a survival mechanism. When everything's uncertain—job security, marriages, the economy, the future—caring too much is dangerous. Better to be cool, detached, ready to pivot. Your generation perfected the shrug. The eye-roll. The 'whatever' that meant 'I care too much to show you I care.'</p><p>At eighteen, Challenger exploded—January 28, 1986. You watched it in your classroom, Christa McAuliffe reaching for the stars, then that forking plume of smoke seventy-three seconds in. This was Gen X's defining moment: the instant optimism died on live television. The systems promising progress could fail spectacularly. The adults running things didn't have answers. You'd suspected this since Nixon, since Vietnam, since the empty house after school. Challenger confirmed it.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> And yet, for all that detachment, you're the generation that actually shows up. You vote. You work. You raise your kids more attentively than you were raised because you remember what it felt like to come home to an empty house. <span class=\"hero-callout\">You can still entertain yourself without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey hypnotized audiences with its vision of AI, space travel, and existential dread. The Beatles released the White Album—'Helter Skelter,' 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps,' 'Blackbird.' Led Zeppelin was forming. Hendrix played the Star-Spangled Banner. You were born at the peak of rock's greatest era, even if you were too young to appreciate it. These were your parents' records, their turntables, their parties bleeding through your bedroom wall.</p><p>Your childhood TV was a revelation of canceled futures. The Six Million Dollar Man—Steve Austin, rebuilt better, stronger, faster. Wonder Woman spinning into her costume. The Incredible Hulk with Bill Bixby's sad eyes and Lou Ferrigno's green rage. These weren't superheroes for kids; they were broken people trying to do good anyway. That resonated.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred. Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! teaching you that every monster was just a greedy adult in a mask. Schoolhouse Rock between cartoons—'I'm Just a Bill,' 'Conjunction Junction,' 'Three is a Magic Number.' You learned more civics from those three-minute songs than from any classroom. Fat Albert with Cosby—complicated now, uncomplicated then. Land of the Lost with its terrible special effects and genuine creepiness.</p><p>At thirteen, MTV launched. August 1, 1981. 'Video Killed the Radio Star' was the first video, and it did. You watched music become visual, watched bands become brands, watched the Buggles prophecy come true. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' wasn't just a music video—it was an event, a fourteen-minute movie that everyone at school discussed the next day. You knew every dance move.</p><p>Your teenage soundtrack was new wave and post-punk. The Cure made sadness sound sophisticated. Depeche Mode made synthesizers emotional. R.E.M. made mumbling an art form. You wore black when you could, thrift-store clothes before they were ironic, band t-shirts that announced your allegiances. Music wasn't background noise—it was identity.</p><p>At sixteen, John Hughes captured your adolescence in ways that felt personal. The Breakfast Club wasn't just a movie—it was validation that adults didn't understand you and maybe didn't try to. Ferris Bueller taught you that systems could be gamed. Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles and Some Kind of Wonderful—these were your field guides to teenage survival. When Hughes died in 2009, it felt like losing the only adult who'd paid attention.</p><p>By your twenties, Nirvana's 'Nevermind' exploded into the mainstream like a bomb. September 1991. Grunge wasn't just music—it was Gen X's scream made audible. Kurt Cobain looked like you, sounded like you felt, said out loud what you'd been thinking. When he died in April 1994, you were twenty-six. It felt less like losing a celebrity and more like losing a translator. Nobody would speak for you quite that clearly again.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>At one, you watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. Your parents held you up to the television, told you to remember this moment. You don't—you were one—but the footage became part of your cultural DNA, replayed endlessly, reminding you that impossible things were possible. Also that America used to do impossible things. Also that the footage looked suspiciously like the special effects in 2001. Trust nothing.</p><p>Your childhood technology was magnificently analog. Rotary phones with cords long enough to stretch into the closet for privacy. Televisions with rabbit ears you adjusted constantly, standing in weird positions because your body was the antenna. Record players with the scratch and pop that Millennials pay extra for now. Cameras with actual film—24 exposures, no do-overs, pick up the prints in a week if you remembered to drop them off.</p><p>At nine, you played Pong. Two white lines, a white dot, revolutionary in 1977. By eleven, Space Invaders was in every arcade, eating quarters, teaching you that repetitive motion and pattern recognition could be addictive. At twelve, Pac-Man arrived. You could probably still draw the ghost patterns from memory. These games weren't hobbies—they were an entire social infrastructure, a reason to go to the mall, a way to measure yourself against friends.</p><p>At thirteen, IBM launched the Personal Computer. You didn't get one—they cost thousands—but you saw them. At sixteen, Apple released the Macintosh with that famous Super Bowl ad. Computers were coming. You took typing classes that would save your career, learned to hunt-and-peck on Apple IIes in school computer labs, wrote papers on word processors that felt like magic after years of typewriters and correction fluid.</p><p>Email arrived when you were in your late twenties. Prodigy, CompuServe, AOL with that screeching modem sound. The internet was a curiosity, then a tool, then everything. You were twenty-seven when Amazon launched, twenty-eight when Google started, thirty-six when Facebook opened to everyone. You remember the before—the world without constant connection, without instant answers, without everyone's opinions in your pocket all the time.</p><p>This makes you the bridge generation. You can troubleshoot a fax machine and set up a VPN. You understand why filing cabinets existed and why they don't anymore. You're old enough to remember life unplugged but young enough to be fluent in digital. Millennials mock your Facebook habits; Gen Z doesn't understand why you answer phone calls. You don't care. You've adapted to more technological change than any generation in history, and you'll adapt to whatever comes next. You always have.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born into chaos. April 4, 1968—Martin Luther King Jr. assassinated. June 5, 1968—Robert Kennedy shot, dead the next day. August 1968—the Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned into televised police riots, cops beating protesters while the whole world watched. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The year of your birth was the year America cracked.</span> Nobody quite put it back together.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At six, you watched Nixon resign.</span> A president caught lying, forced out, helicoptering away in disgrace. At seven, Saigon fell. April 30, 1975. You watched helicopters evacuating the embassy on that wood-paneled TV, people clinging to skids, a war your country lost being abandoned in real time. The draft that haunted your older brothers ended. Vietnam Veterans came home to nothing—no parades, no thanks, just suspicion and neglect. You learned that wars don't always have good guys, and they definitely don't always end well.</p><p>At nine, the Bicentennial—1976. Tall ships, fireworks, red-white-and-blue everything. America tried to feel good about itself for one summer. It worked, sort of. Then it was over, and there was still inflation, still gas lines, still malaise. Jimmy Carter talked about national malaise, which was probably honest and definitely not what people wanted to hear.</p><p>At eleven, you witnessed history through closed-circuit television at school when Elvis died. August 16, 1977. Your parents cried. You didn't quite understand why a fat guy in a jumpsuit mattered so much. Star Wars had opened three months earlier—that's what you cared about. But you'd learn later: Elvis mattered because he was their rebellion, their youth, their proof that things could change. Now he was gone.</p><p>At thirteen, the Iranian hostage crisis began—<span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days of Americans held captive. At eighteen, Challenger's smoke trail spread across the Florida sky—a moment so defining for Gen X that it shaped your generation's permanent skepticism of progress and institutions.</p><p>At twenty-one, the Berlin Wall fell. November 9, 1989. You watched people chip at concrete with hammers, strangers hugging, champagne flowing. The Cold War that had defined your entire life—the drills, the movies, the constant background radiation of potential annihilation—just ended. Not with a bang but with a party. You were young enough to celebrate, old enough to wonder what came next.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> You were at work, probably. Someone said a plane hit the World Trade Center. You found a television in time to watch the second plane hit live. The towers fell. Three thousand people died. The world you knew, the post-Cold War optimism, the 'end of history'—all of it collapsed with those buildings. You were old enough to have a life that would be forever divided into before and after.</p><p>At forty, the economy collapsed. September 2008. Lehman Brothers, then everything else. Your 401(k) lost <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span>. Your home lost value. Your job became precarious. You were too young to retire, too old to start over, and suddenly aware that everything you'd built on what you thought was solid ground was actually quicksand. Some of your friends never recovered. Some marriages didn't survive. The American Dream revealed itself as a variable, not a constant.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about what you walked into. And what walked into you.</p><p>You graduated college around 1990, into a recession. Not the Great Recession—that would come later—but bad enough. Entry-level jobs were scarce. Your degree, which you were promised would open doors, mostly opened rejection letters. You took what you could get. Temp work. Contract gigs. Jobs that had nothing to do with your major. The career ladder your parents climbed was already being disassembled when you tried to put your foot on the first rung.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the precarious employment that became normal for everyone after. You were the first to hear that pensions were extinct. The first to be told that loyalty was outdated. The first to watch companies lay off 20% of the workforce and call it 'rightsizing' while executives got bonuses. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> You learned the rules: no one was coming to save you, careers were portfolios not progressions, and 'we're like a family here' was a red flag, not a promise. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span></p><p>You adapted because adaptation was survival. You learned new software every two years because the old software was obsolete. You retrained, pivoted, 'reinvented yourself'—corporate-speak for doing whatever it took to stay employed. You became fluent in buzzwords: synergy, paradigm shift, thinking outside the box. You hated the language but spoke it anyway.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived.</span> By forty, you were supposed to be hitting your peak earning years. Some of you were. Then 2008 happened, and those earnings peaked into a crater. You lost equity. You lost savings. You lost the illusion that hard work guaranteed security. You were too expensive to hire at entry level, too young to take early retirement, and too experienced for anyone to believe you'd stick around.</p><p>Now, in your fifties, you're running the world that everyone else complains about. You're the managers, the executives, the ones making decisions in meetings that younger people resent. You're also the ones getting quietly aged out, offered 'voluntary separation packages,' training your replacements who cost half as much. Ageism is real, even when you're the one with answers.</p><p>The gig economy that Millennials rail against? You invented it, not by choice but by necessity. You were Uber before there were apps—contract workers, freelancers, consultants who were really just employees without benefits. You know exactly what younger workers are going through because you went through it first. The difference is, you didn't expect anyone to fix it. You just figured out how to survive it.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Did you ever wait by the phone for someone to call? Actually wait, tethered to the wall by a coiled cord, unable to leave the house because there was no way to reach you if you did? Did you know their number by heart because you had to dial it, rotary style, feeling each click? That was intimacy in the pre-digital age: presence, patience, memorization of the numbers that mattered.</p><p>You learned to flirt in person because there was no other option. Notes passed in class, folded into elaborate origami. Mixed tapes with carefully curated tracks that said everything you couldn't. Phone calls that lasted hours, receiver cradled between ear and shoulder, saying nothing and everything until your parents yelled at you to get off the line. Romance was analog, tactile, time-consuming. It required effort that screens have since made optional.</p><p>Your generation normalized divorce before it became universal. Half your friends' parents split up. You shuttled between houses, negotiated custody schedules, learned that love didn't always last and that was okay—or at least survivable. This made you both more cautious about marriage and more realistic about it. You weren't looking for fairy tales. You'd seen how those ended.</p><p>You probably married later than your parents but earlier than Millennials. The median age for first marriage shifted during your cohort, from early twenties to late twenties. You had options your mother didn't: careers, birth control, the ability to wait. You used them. Some of you waited too long. Some didn't wait at all. There's no right answer, only the one you chose.</p><p>Long-distance relationships used to mean expensive phone calls and handwritten letters that took days to arrive. You remember when staying in touch required intention, stamps, driving to the airport to meet someone at the gate. Now you video-chat across continents as if it's nothing. You've lived both realities. Neither feels normal anymore.</p><p>Your communication style confuses younger people. You call instead of texting. You send emails with proper salutations. You show up in person when a Zoom would suffice. This isn't technophobia—you've adopted every technology thrown at you—it's just that you learned communication in a world where presence was the default, and some habits run deep.</p><p>You've maintained friendships for forty years using whatever technology existed at the time. High school friends you've emailed since 1995. College roommates you found on Facebook in 2007. The wedding party that has a group text now. Your relationships span eras, technologies, life stages. You've kept people close across decades and distances. That's a skill younger generations will eventually need. You could teach them, if they'd ask.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your earliest money memories are from the stagflation seventies. Gas lines. Your parents arguing about bills. Inflation that made prices rise while wages stayed flat—a word you learned before you understood what it meant, just that it was bad. You absorbed financial anxiety before you had any finances to be anxious about.</p><p>Then the eighties hit, and suddenly greed was good. Wall Street made money seem like a game. Reagan promised morning in America. Yuppies appeared, spending ostentatiously, treating wealth as a moral virtue. Mortgage rates hit <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span> in the early '80s. You were a teenager watching this, uncertain which message to believe: your parents' Depression-era caution or the culture's new worship of excess.</p><p>You entered the workforce when housing was still affordable—barely, but possible. In 1990, the median home cost about three times the median income. You could buy something if you saved. Many of you did. You got houses, equity, the first rungs of wealth accumulation. This makes you luckier than Millennials, who graduated into a world where the same house costs six times the median income. But you're not as lucky as Boomers, who bought for two times income and watched their investments quadruple.</p><p>The 2008 crash hit you at exactly the wrong time. You'd accumulated something—a house, a 401(k), a sense of stability. Then you watched it evaporate. Home equity vanished. Retirement accounts lost <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span> in months. Jobs you thought were secure turned out to be line items someone could cut. You were forty, too old to start over, too young to give up. The recovery was real but uneven. Some of you are fine. Some never recovered. The median obscures the range.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during your prime earning years.</span> Your approach to money is practical, skeptical, and slightly paranoid. You save because you've seen crashes. You invest because you don't trust Social Security to survive. You budget because you remember when your parents couldn't make ends meet. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Financial planning isn't a hobby—it's a trauma response dressed up in spreadsheets.</span></p><p>Now you're sandwiched. Your Boomer parents may need care that costs more than you've saved—nursing homes run $8,000 a month, and Medicare doesn't cover it. Your Millennial or Gen Z kids can't afford rent, student loans, life—and they need help you can barely provide. You're supporting people on both ends while your own retirement remains uncertain. This is the squeeze that nobody talks about because admitting financial stress still feels shameful, especially for a generation that was supposed to be self-reliant.</p><p>Retirement planning has become a math problem that keeps changing its variables. Social Security's future is uncertain. Healthcare costs compound annually. The pension your parents counted on doesn't exist. You run the numbers, and they rarely add up to certainty. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The anxiety doesn't go away; you've just learned to function around it.</span></p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your independence is your superpower and your cage. You're so accustomed to figuring things out alone that asking for help feels like failure. Therapy? You should be able to handle it. Mentorship? You figured it out yourself. Career counseling? Just work harder. You wear self-reliance like armor, never noticing how heavy it's gotten.</p><p>You're dismissive of genuine distress in ways you don't always recognize. When younger workers complain about burnout, you think: we had it worse, and we didn't whine. When they demand work-life balance, you think: balance is a luxury, welcome to adulthood. This isn't wisdom—it's just trauma normalized. The fact that you survived dysfunction doesn't mean dysfunction was okay.</p><p>Your ironic detachment has calcified into genuine disconnection. You can't be earnest without hedging. You can't advocate without caveats. 'Whatever' was a pose at twenty; at fifty-five, it's a habit that keeps you from caring about things that deserve care. Younger generations are learning to be sincere in ways you never could. It's uncomfortable to watch because it highlights what you lost.</p><p>You underestimate how much the world changed for people who came after. 'I bought my first house at thirty' ignores that houses cost twice as much relative to income now. 'I worked my way through college' ignores that tuition has increased 1,200% since you enrolled. The math is different. The economy is different. Your experience, while real, isn't automatically transferable.</p><p>You tend toward individual solutions to collective problems. Can't afford healthcare? Get a better job. Can't retire? Save more money. Can't buy a house? Skip the avocado toast. These answers feel practical because they're the only ones you were ever given. But they're also ways of avoiding the harder question: what if the system is broken, and individual hustle can't fix it?</p><p>You're skeptical of collective action in ways that sometimes hurt you. Unions seemed irrelevant when you were young—relics of an industrial age. Now you're watching younger workers organize, demand better, refuse to accept what you accepted. Part of you admires it. Part of you resents that they expect change while you just adapted. Neither reaction is entirely fair.</p><p>And here's the deepest blind spot: you think your skepticism makes you immune to being wrong. You've questioned everything so thoroughly that you've stopped questioning your own assumptions. Your pattern recognition—so useful for spotting scams and hollow promises—can also blind you to genuine change, real progress, things that deserve belief. Cynicism is a tool, not a worldview. Sometimes the sincere thing is true, and the ironic dismissal misses it entirely.</p>"

The Berlin Wall fell when you were twenty-one. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were twenty-three. History was supposedly over—liberal democracy had won, the future was bright, the only direction was up. You got jobs, lost jobs, moved cities, tried careers that didn't stick. The dot-com boom made twenty-five-year-olds millionaires, at least on paper. You were finding yourself in a world that seemed to be finding itself too. Grunge gave you a soundtrack. The Simpsons gave you permission to be cynical. 'Friends' gave you an unrealistic expectation of Manhattan apartment sizes. By the end of this decade, you were probably settling into something resembling adult life—relationships, careers, the first outlines of who you'd become.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1998-2008):</strong> September 11, 2001 shattered the peace dividend. You were thirty-three, old enough to have a life that would be permanently altered. The wars that followed seemed necessary, then endless, then pointless. You watched the country you knew transform into something angrier and more afraid. Meanwhile, you were building: buying houses (which seemed smart), starting families (which changed everything), advancing careers (which felt increasingly precarious). The decade ended with the 2008 financial crisis, which hit when you were forty—perfect timing to watch everything you'd built lose value overnight.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2008-2018):</strong> Your forties were about rebuilding from wreckage that wasn't your fault. The recession recovery was slow and uneven. You lost equity, retirement savings, sometimes jobs. You were too old to be entry-level, too young to retire, and suddenly aware that 'middle class' was a moving target that kept moving away. Some of you thrived—promotions, leadership, peak earnings. Some of you just survived. Many of you did both, depending on the year. Your kids were teenagers now, or heading that way, and you were determined to be more present than your parents were. You weren't always successful. Parenting is hard; you knew that now.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2018-2028):</strong> You're here. COVID arrived when you were fifty-two, adding one more 'unprecedented' event to a lifetime of them. Working from home, worrying about parents in nursing homes, watching the world argue about masks and vaccines. Your fifties are about navigating the endgame—careers winding down or winding up depending on luck and industry, retirement visible but not necessarily achievable, parents aging and kids struggling. You're the sandwich generation, managing everyone's needs while yours get deferred. The world you're leaving your children is worse than the one you inherited, and you know it, and you don't know what to do about it.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2028-2038) and beyond:</strong> Retirement, if it happens, won't look like your parents' version. No pension, probably. Social Security, hopefully, but reduced. You'll work longer than you planned, either by choice or necessity. Your health will matter more than ever because American healthcare is designed to extract maximum value from anyone unlucky enough to get sick. Climate change will reshape where people can live—some of the places you know will be different, some will be gone. Technology will continue accelerating in ways that feel absurd. You'll adapt, because that's what you do. You've been adapting since the key around your neck let you into an empty house. At least now you get to choose the house.</p>"

You're the demographic middle child, overlooked when attention was distributed, blamed when things went wrong, expected to mediate without getting credit.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> You're more educated, more divorced, and significantly less wealthy at the same age. Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth when they were your age. You control 14%. They got pensions; you got 401(k)s and the advice to figure it out yourself. They bought houses for two years' salary; you bought for three or four. They had careers at single companies; you had portfolios of gigs and pivots. They believed the system would reward hard work; you learned the system would discard you the moment the spreadsheet said so. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They had Woodstock. You had Lollapalooza. Neither changed the world as much as advertised.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> You're similar in outlook but different in expression. You were both betrayed by economic promises—they just got it worse. You graduated into recession; they graduated into the Great Recession. You had expensive housing; they have impossible housing. You learned to be self-reliant; they learned to demand better. The difference is mostly timing and volume. You suffer in silence because that's how you were raised. They talk about it because they outnumber you and social media exists. You understand each other's complaints. You just process them differently.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You're from different worlds. They've never known life without smartphones, social media, or school shooting drills. They're more anxious, more connected, more politically vocal. They're also more earnest—they care about things without ironic distance, which you find either refreshing or exhausting depending on your mood. They call you old, which you technically are. They don't understand your cultural references. They've never rewound a VHS tape or waited for a song to come on the radio so they could tape it. They think 'dial' refers to a phone feature, not a physical action. The gap is wide, but you were young once too, equally confusing to your elders.</p><p>Your generation's life expectancy is around <span class=\"stat-box\">76-78</span> years—slightly lower than Boomers, partly due to increased 'deaths of despair': suicide, overdose, alcoholism.
