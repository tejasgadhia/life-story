      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You arrived the year America lost its mind. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April. Robert Kennedy was shot in June, two months before you were born. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned into a police riot broadcast on live television. Your birth year was the year the country broke, and nobody quite figured out how to put it back together.</p><p>Your first years were Watergate years. While you were learning to walk and talk, Richard Nixon was learning that crime does, in fact, have consequences if you're dumb enough to record yourself committing it. You were six when he resigned. Your earliest political memory is probably a president leaving in disgrace. Welcome to civic life.</p><p>Your childhood straddled the 1970s, which meant avocado-green appliances, wood-paneled station wagons, and a pervasive sense that the good times were over. The oil crisis hit when you were five. Gas lines stretched around blocks. Your parents worried about things like inflation and stagflation—words you didn't understand but knew were bad because adults whispered them.</p><p>You were a latchkey kid before anyone called it that. Both parents worked, or your single parent worked, and you let yourself in after school with a key around your neck. You heated up your own dinner. You watched TV unsupervised. You learned self-reliance not because anyone taught you, but because no one was there to do things for you.</p><p>The pop culture of your childhood was darker than what came before. Movies got grittier. Music got angrier. The optimism of the 1960s curdled into the cynicism of the 1970s. You grew up in the hangover of a decade that promised revolution and delivered disco. By the time Star Wars arrived in 1977, you were ready for an escape to a galaxy far, far away. Anything was better than the one you were stuck in.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Generation X</h2><p>You're Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980. The name came from a Douglas Coupland novel, which tells you everything you need to know about how seriously marketers took you. You were the 'slacker' generation, the 'whatever' generation, the generation that watched the Boomers wreck the economy and decided not to care because caring seemed pointless.</p><p>Your generation is roughly 65 million people in the US, sandwiched between the massive Boomer cohort and the even more massive Millennial cohort. You're the middle child of American demographics—overlooked, underestimated, and quietly resentful about it.</p><p>The defining characteristic of Gen X is skepticism. You don't trust institutions because you've watched them fail repeatedly. You don't trust corporations because you've seen layoffs treat employees like disposable parts. You don't trust government because your formative political memories are Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Clinton's impeachment. Trust has to be earned, and most things haven't earned it.</p><p>You're the first generation to do worse than your parents economically, but nobody talks about that because Millennials have it even worse and make more noise about it. You pioneered the precarious employment that became normal for everyone who came after. You were the beta test for the end of the American Dream.</p><p>Your generation gave the world grunge, alternative rock, and the ironic detachment that became the default cultural mode. You invented MTV culture before MTV sold out. You were cynical before cynicism was cool, and then cynicism became so cool that it stopped meaning anything. Now you're watching younger generations discover earnestness, and you're not sure whether to be relieved or annoyed.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year 2001: A Space Odyssey blew minds in theaters. Kubrick's film predicted video calls, tablet computers, and artificial intelligence going rogue—and got the timeline about two decades off. The Graduate was a year old and already defining what generational alienation looked like. Planet of the Apes revealed the Statue of Liberty buried in sand, which was basically a preview of the next fifty years of American optimism.</p><p>Musically, 1968 gave us The White Album, Beggars Banquet, and Electric Ladyland. The Beatles were falling apart, the Stones were getting dangerous, and Hendrix was reinventing what a guitar could do. You were too young to appreciate any of it, but it was the sonic wallpaper of your early childhood—heard from the next room while your parents had friends over.</p><p>Your childhood was Saturday morning cartoons and Schoolhouse Rock. You learned about conjunctions from a singing bill on Capitol Hill. Television was three networks, maybe PBS if your parents were ambitious. You couldn't pause, rewind, or record anything. If you missed it, you missed it. Delayed gratification wasn't a virtue—it was the only option.</p><p>Your teenage years were MTV's golden age. You watched 'Video Killed the Radio Star' launch the channel in 1981. Music videos became the art form of your generation. You knew every frame of 'Thriller,' every shot of 'Take On Me.' MTV News felt like real news for people your age. It wasn't—but it felt that way.</p><p>By your twenties, your generation's music dominated. Nirvana's 'Nevermind' in 1991 wasn't just an album—it was a generational manifesto. Grunge was the sound of disaffected kids who'd been told they'd never amount to anything and decided to make music about it. Kurt Cobain died when you were 26, which felt like the end of something that had barely started.</p><p>Your pop culture references mark you in ways you can't escape. You quote The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller, Heathers. You know why 'Reality Bites' was both celebrated and mocked. You watched Friends become the show everyone talked about and The Simpsons become the show that actually mattered. You're the last generation to remember life before irony ate everything.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born before the moon landing. Think about that. Humanity hadn't walked on another celestial body yet. The computing power that put Armstrong on the lunar surface was less than what's in a modern calculator. The technology that defined the late 20th century was still science fiction when you arrived.</p><p>Your childhood was analog in ways younger people can't comprehend. Phones had cords and rotary dials. Televisions had tubes and rabbit ears. Cameras had film you dropped off at the drugstore and picked up a week later. Music came on vinyl, then cassettes. Information came from encyclopedias and libraries, not search engines.</p><p>You were 13 when IBM launched the personal computer. 16 when Apple introduced the Macintosh. You watched computers go from room-sized mainframes to desktop machines to laptops to phones. You're the generation that learned to type in high school, adopted email in your twenties, and figured out smartphones in your forties. You've adapted to more technological change than any generation in history.</p><p>The internet arrived when you were already an adult. You were 27 when Amazon launched, 28 when Google started, 36 when Facebook opened to the public. Unlike Millennials, who grew up online, you remember the world before constant connectivity. You know what it's like to be unreachable, to not know something and have no way to look it up, to be bored without a screen to fill the void.</p><p>This perspective makes you valuable in ways the market doesn't always recognize. You can operate in both worlds. You understand analog systems that still matter—landlines, fax machines, paper records. You also understand digital systems well enough to function. You're the bridge generation, fluent in both languages, belonging fully to neither.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is practical, not religious. You use tools that work and abandon ones that don't. You're not impressed by the latest app because you've watched a thousand 'revolutionary' technologies come and go. You remember when email was going to change everything. It did, but not the way anyone predicted.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were 18 when the Challenger exploded. January 28, 1986. You probably watched it live, either in school or at home. A teacher was on board—Christa McAuliffe—which made it feel personal in a way space disasters usually didn't. The footage of that Y-shaped smoke trail played on loop for days. American exceptionalism took a hit that morning, and nothing quite filled the crater.</p><p>You were 21 when the Berlin Wall fell. November 9, 1989. The Cold War that had defined your parents' entire worldview ended with people chipping at concrete with hammers. The Soviet Union collapsed two years later. The existential threat of nuclear annihilation that had hung over everyone's childhood suddenly evaporated. Nobody knew what came next. Turns out it was economic anxiety and new forms of terrorism.</p><p>You were 23 during the first Gulf War. CNN made its name broadcasting live from Baghdad. It was the first war that looked like a video game, all night-vision green and precision munitions. It was over fast, which made everyone think modern wars would all be quick and clean. That assumption aged poorly.</p><p>You were 33 on September 11, 2001. Old enough to understand exactly what it meant, established enough to have a life that would be permanently altered. You watched the towers fall in real time. You remember where you were when you heard, when you saw, when the second plane hit and you knew it wasn't an accident. The wars that followed defined the next two decades and counting.</p><p>You were 40 during the 2008 financial crisis. You'd built a career, maybe bought a house, probably had a 401(k) that lost half its value in months. You were too old to start over, too young to retire, and suddenly aware that everything you'd built could evaporate. Some of your peers never recovered. Marriages ended. Houses were foreclosed. The middle-class stability you'd worked toward turned out to be an illusion.</p><p>You were 52 when COVID-19 arrived. Old enough to be in the high-risk category, young enough to still be working. You pivoted to remote work, watched your kids struggle with online school, worried about parents in nursing homes. The world stopped, then lurched forward in ways that didn't make sense. You're still processing it. Everyone is.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1990, give or take. The economy was in recession, but nothing like what came later. You probably job-hopped in your twenties because that's what you were supposed to do—build experience, find your niche, climb the ladder. The ladder still existed back then, even if it was starting to wobble.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the work-life imbalance that became normal for everyone after. You were the first cohort expected to answer emails at 10 PM, to be available on weekends, to treat boundaries as optional. Smartphones didn't cause this—the cultural expectations were already there. Technology just made it impossible to escape.</p><p>You watched corporate loyalty become a one-way street. Companies expected devotion but offered no job security in return. Layoffs were 'rightsizing.' Outsourcing was 'efficiency.' Pensions were replaced with 401(k)s that put all the risk on you. You learned that employers would discard you the moment the spreadsheet said so, regardless of your years of service.</p><p>By your forties, you were supposed to be in your peak earning years. Some of you were. Many weren't. The 2008 crash vaporized wealth your generation had spent decades building. You lost equity, retirement savings, career momentum. You were too experienced to hire cheap, too young to take early retirement, and stuck in a labor market that increasingly valued youth over wisdom.</p><p>Now, in your fifties, you're navigating the endgame of careers built on shifting sand. Retirement seems distant or impossible. Ageism in hiring is real and pervasive. You've got decades of experience that companies want to access without actually paying for. You're training younger managers who earn more than you do because they were hired recently and salary bands have changed.</p><p>The silver lining, if there is one, is that your generation figured out how to survive instability before anyone else. You're adaptable because you had to be. You're self-reliant because institutions weren't. You've been through enough economic cycles to know that panic doesn't help and planning only goes so far. You'll figure it out. You always have.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that bridged the gap between analog and digital relationships. You met your first partners in person—at school, at work, at bars, through friends. Dating meant actual dates. Phone calls meant actual conversations on actual telephones. You learned to read faces and body language because screens weren't there to hide behind.</p><p>You probably got married younger than Millennials, but later than Boomers. The median age shifted during your cohort. Divorce was common and less stigmatized than it had been for your parents. You were the first generation to normalize the blended family, the second marriage, the 'it's complicated' relationship status before Facebook gave it a name.</p><p>Communication evolved throughout your adult life. You went from handwritten letters to email to texting to social media, each transition feeling revolutionary and then immediately normal. You remember when long-distance calls were expensive, when staying in touch required effort, when friendships could fade simply because people moved away and letters took too long.</p><p>Your generation's communication style is direct in ways that younger people sometimes find jarring. You call instead of text. You show up instead of messaging first. You say what you mean because you learned to communicate before tone could be softened with emojis. This reads as blunt to generations raised on constant digital hedging.</p><p>You've maintained relationships across decades using whatever technology existed at the time. Friends from high school you've emailed since 1995. College roommates you reconnected with on Facebook. Work colleagues you've texted for fifteen years. Your relationship history is scattered across obsolete platforms and forgotten passwords. Somewhere, there's an AOL account with emails you'll never see again.</p><p>Marriage and partnership in your generation look different than they did for your parents. You've negotiated dual-career households, shared childcare, and evolving expectations about domestic labor. You've watched gender roles shift dramatically over your lifetime. You're not quite as egalitarian as you think you are, but you're trying. Most of you are trying.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by the 1970s stagflation of your childhood, the 1980s excess of your adolescence, and the successive crashes that punctuated your adult life. You've seen economies boom and collapse, fortunes made and lost, the rules change repeatedly. Nothing feels stable because nothing has been.</p><p>You were supposed to be the generation that accumulated wealth. Housing was still affordable when you were in your twenties. The stock market had its best run in history during your thirties. If you got in early, you did fine. If you didn't—if you graduated into a recession, if you had student loans, if you made any of the normal mistakes young people make—you fell behind and never caught up.</p><p>The 2008 crash hit your generation at the worst possible time. You'd built equity in homes that suddenly were worth less than you owed. You'd accumulated retirement savings that lost 40% in months. You were old enough to have something to lose, young enough to feel it for decades. Some of you recovered. Many didn't. The recovery was uneven and the scars are permanent.</p><p>Your approach to money is practical and anxious. You save because you've seen what happens when you don't. You invest because you don't trust Social Security to be there. You carry financial trauma that expresses itself in penny-pinching or panic-spending or both. Every economic downturn triggers flashbacks to the ones before.</p><p>You're sandwiched financially between generations. Your Boomer parents may need care that costs more than you've saved. Your Millennial or Gen Z kids need help that you can't quite afford to give. You're supporting people on both ends while your own retirement remains uncertain. This is the squeeze that nobody talks about because admitting financial stress still feels shameful.</p><p>The generational wealth gap affects you less than Millennials but more than you'd like to admit. Boomers got houses for a year's salary. You got houses for three years' salary. Millennials get to rent forever. You're in the middle—not as screwed as those who came after, but not as comfortable as those who came before.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest strength is independence. Your greatest weakness is that same independence taken too far. You're so used to figuring things out alone that you don't ask for help when you need it. You'd rather struggle in silence than admit vulnerability. This looks like strength but often is just stubbornness wearing a trench coat.</p><p>You're dismissive in ways you don't always recognize. The 'whatever' attitude that defined your youth has calcified into genuine apathy about things that deserve engagement. You've seen so many movements fail that you're skeptical of all movements. You've watched so many promises break that you've stopped believing promises. This protects you from disappointment but also from hope.</p><p>Your ironic detachment was a survival mechanism that became a prison. You can't be earnest without hedging. You can't care without qualifying. Everything gets filtered through a layer of cool distance that keeps you safe but also keeps you disconnected. Younger generations are learning to be genuine in ways you never could, and it's both admirable and uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>You have a complicated relationship with your own obsolescence. Technology you mastered becomes outdated. Cultural references you treasure mean nothing to people born after them. The skills that made you valuable are being automated or outsourced. You're not old yet, but you're not young, and the world has shifted around you in ways that feel faster than they should.</p><p>Your generation tends toward individual solutions to systemic problems. Can't afford healthcare? Get a better job. Can't retire? Save more money. Can't buy a house? Work harder. You know these answers are inadequate, but they're the only ones you were given, and you've internalized them even when you know better. Collective action feels foreign because you were raised to go it alone.</p><p>You're not as good at mentoring as you could be. The neglect you experienced as latchkey kids taught you to expect people to figure things out themselves. You don't always realize when younger colleagues need guidance, or you assume they'll ask if they need help. They won't. They're intimidated. You have to reach out. It doesn't come naturally, but it matters.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You came of age as the Cold War ended and the internet began. The world felt full of possibility, even if the economy was shaky. You job-hopped, moved cities, figured out what you wanted to do. Some of you married young; others didn't marry at all. Grunge gave you a soundtrack for your alienation. The Simpsons gave you a weekly dose of irony. You were finding yourself in a world that was also finding itself, post-Soviet and pre-9/11, in that brief optimistic window that would close hard on September 11, 2001.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> 9/11 happened when you were 33. The decade before had been a dot-com boom and bust, a Clinton economy that felt stable, a sense that things were basically okay. Then the towers fell and nothing was okay again. You were old enough to have established lives disrupted, careers derailed, worldviews shattered. The wars that followed seemed endless because they were. Your thirties were about building stability in an unstable world, having kids or deciding not to, buying houses that would later be underwater, trusting institutions that would fail you.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> The 2008 crash hit when you were 40. Perfect timing, as these things go. Your peak earning years were supposed to be consolidating wealth, and instead you were watching it evaporate. Homes lost value. Retirement accounts cratered. Job security vanished for anyone who had any left. You pivoted, adapted, survived—as you always had. Your forties were about rebuilding from wreckage that wasn't your fault but was definitely your problem.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> You're here now. COVID arrived when you were 52, upending whatever stability you'd rebuilt. Working from home, worrying about aging parents, watching the world shut down. Your fifties are about navigating the endgame of careers built on shifting foundations. Retirement is visible but not necessarily achievable. Your parents need care. Your kids need help. You're sandwiched between generations, managing everyone's needs while your own get deferred.</p><p><strong>Your 60s ({{SIXTIES_START}} and beyond):</strong> Retirement, if it happens, won't look like your parents' version. You'll probably work longer, either by choice or necessity. Social Security will exist, probably, but won't be enough. You'll rely on savings you spent decades building, assuming the market didn't eat them. Your health will matter more than ever because American healthcare is designed to bankrupt anyone who gets seriously sick. The world will continue changing faster than feels reasonable. Climate will be worse. Technology will be weirder. You'll adapt because that's what you do. You always have.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>Your birth cohort was approximately 3.5 million people. Generation X as a whole is about 65 million Americans, smaller than the Boomers before and the Millennials after. You're the demographic middle child—overlooked when resources were distributed, blamed when things went wrong, expected to mediate between larger siblings who get more attention.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), you're more educated, more divorced, and significantly less wealthy at the same age. Boomers controlled about 21% of national wealth when they were your current age. Gen X controls about 14%. The gap isn't as dramatic as the Millennial wealth gap, but it's real. Boomers got pensions, affordable housing, and stable careers. You got 401(k)s, bidding wars, and the gig economy.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're similar in outlook but different in experience. Millennials graduated into the 2008 crash; you were mid-career and had something to lose. Millennials were digital natives; you had to learn. Millennials talk about their problems; you were raised to suffer in silence. You understand each other's complaints but express them differently.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. They've never known a world without smartphones, social media, or school shooting drills. They're more anxious, more connected, more politically active. They're also more earnest in ways that you find either refreshing or exhausting, depending on the day. They call you 'Gen X' like it's ancient history. They're not wrong.</p><p>Your generation's life expectancy is 78-79 years, slightly lower than Boomers due to increased rates of mortality from drugs, alcohol, and suicide. The 'deaths of despair' that researchers study hit your generation hard, especially among those without college degrees. Economic precarity kills, slowly, in ways that don't make headlines.</p><p>But your generation also pioneered changes that made life better for everyone after. You normalized working mothers, dual-income households, involved fathers. You challenged workplace discrimination even as you benefited from it. You laid groundwork for marriage equality, even if younger generations finished the job. History will remember you as the bridge generation—the last to remember analog life, the first to navigate digital chaos, the ones who held things together while everyone else got the credit.</p>"
