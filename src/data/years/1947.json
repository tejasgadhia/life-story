      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1947-1959</h2><p>The smell of Ovaltine warming on the stove. The crackle of the Philco radio bringing Jack Benny into your living room. The satisfying clunk of Lincoln Logs fitting together, building frontier cabins on the living room floor while your mother ran the Hoover over the braided rug. Your childhood had a weight to it—everything was wood, metal, and Bakelite. Nothing was disposable because nothing could be.</p><p>At five, you were glued to the radio. The Lone Ranger and Tonto on Monday nights. The Shadow on Sundays. Fibber McGee and Molly with that closet gag that got you every single time. You learned to visualize stories from sound alone—a skill your grandchildren, raised on screens, will never develop. The Green Hornet's buzzing theme. Inner Sanctum's creaking door. These sounds were your first special effects.</p><p>By seven, television arrived—if your family could afford one. A ten-inch DuMont screen in a cabinet the size of a refrigerator, neighbors crowded around to watch Howdy Doody or Kukla, Fran and Ollie. The test pattern. The static. The miracle of moving pictures in your own home. Your parents had grown up with silent films; you watched Milton Berle in your pajamas. The future had arrived in your living room.</p><p>Saturday afternoons meant the movie theater: a quarter for admission, a nickel for popcorn, a double feature, cartoons, a newsreel, and a serial that ended on a cliffhanger so you'd have to come back next week. You saw cowboys and Indians, war movies about the conflict your father had just returned from, and monster pictures that gave you nightmares you'd never admit to. The velvet seats. The Art Deco lobby. The darkness that felt like church.</p><p>Your toys were built to last because they had to. Erector Sets with actual metal girders. Tinker Toys that smelled like wood shavings. A Flexible Flyer sled for winters that seemed longer and snowier than winters today. Cap guns and holsters for playing cowboys. Paper dolls for your sisters. A Radio Flyer wagon that probably still exists somewhere in someone's garage, red paint faded but axles intact.</p><p>At ten, Sputnik crossed the night sky and everything changed. You were outside playing kick the can when someone's father called everyone over to watch the blinking light pass overhead. The Russians had beaten America to space. Your teachers started emphasizing math and science with new urgency. The Space Race had begun, and you were old enough to understand that losing meant something terrible—though nobody could quite explain what.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The term was coined for the population explosion that began nine months after V-J Day, when your fathers came home from Europe and the Pacific with one thing on their minds. You were part of the first wave—born in 1947, the second year of the boom—and there were 3.8 million of you that year alone. Your parents didn't stop there. They kept having babies until 1964, producing 76 million of you, the largest generation America had ever seen.</p><p>You were sixteen when JFK was shot. Eighteen during the Watts riots. Twenty when the Summer of Love promised to change everything. Twenty-two at Woodstock—old enough to have been there, young enough to still believe in what it represented. Your generation didn't just witness the '60s; you were its foot soldiers, its protesters, its casualties, and eventually, its inheritors.</p><p>Being an early Boomer meant something different than being a late one. You actually remember Eisenhower. You watched the '50s unfold from inside them, not from textbooks. When Vietnam came, you were draft age—not too young to worry about it, not old enough to have already served. The lottery number you drew, or didn't, shaped the rest of your life. Some of your high school classmates came home in boxes. Others came home different. Others didn't go at all and carry different kinds of weight.</p><p>Your generation's story has two chapters that don't quite connect. Chapter one: you marched for civil rights, protested an immoral war, demanded equality for women, and questioned every institution your parents had built. Chapter two: you voted for Reagan, dismantled the safety net, accumulated more wealth than any generation in history, and told your children they weren't working hard enough. Both chapters are true. Both are incomplete.</p><p>Your generation's defining contradiction: you questioned everything, then became the establishment you once challenged. The '60s taught you to distrust authority. The decades that followed made you the authority. Whether you personally embraced that transformation or fought it, the pattern defines how younger generations see you. Fair or not, you're the generation that got the ladder and then—the narrative goes—pulled it up.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Jackie Robinson stepped onto Ebbets Field for the Brooklyn Dodgers, two months before your first birthday. You didn't understand it then—you couldn't—but you grew up in a country that was different because of what happened that April. Robinson took the abuse, the death threats, the spikings, and the hotels that wouldn't let him stay with his teammates. Baseball integrated seven years before public schools did. Sometimes sports leads where law is afraid to go.</p><p>At six, you gathered around the radio with 82 million other Americans to hear Bobby Thomson's 'Shot Heard Round the World'—the Giants winning the pennant on a ninth-inning home run. At seven, I Love Lucy premiered, and suddenly everyone knew who Lucy and Desi were, what they were doing Monday nights, and why Lucy was always scheming. At eight, you watched the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the first global television event—2 million Americans saw it live, and your family might have been among them, clustered around a neighbor's tiny screen.</p><p>The music of your childhood was Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Patti Page, and the Ames Brothers—smooth, safe, sponsored by cigarette companies. Then at nine, 'Rock Around the Clock' played over the credits of Blackboard Jungle, and something cracked open. At eleven, Elvis Presley appeared on Ed Sullivan, filmed from the waist up because his hips were obscene. At twelve, American Bandstand went national, and suddenly teenagers had their own music, their own dances, their own culture that parents didn't understand and couldn't control.</p><p>Your teenage years were soundtracked by the birth of rock and roll. Buddy Holly and the Crickets. Little Richard screaming 'Tutti Frutti.' Chuck Berry duck-walking across stages. The Everly Brothers harmonizing about waking up. Ritchie Valens with 'La Bamba.' Then the plane crash—you were eleven when Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper died in an Iowa cornfield. The Day the Music Died. You remember exactly where you were when you heard.</p><p>At sixteen, the Beatles landed at JFK Airport and appeared on Ed Sullivan, and 73 million people watched—the largest television audience in American history at that point. At seventeen, Dylan went electric at Newport and got booed by folk purists. At nineteen, the Summer of Love promised peace and understanding. At twenty-two, you were the right age for Woodstock—half a million people in a muddy field, Hendrix playing the 'Star-Spangled Banner' at dawn, the counterculture's high-water mark before the tide went out.</p><p>The movies of your youth shifted from Doris Day to Dennis Hopper. At nineteen, Bonnie and Clyde reinvented screen violence. At twenty-one, 2001: A Space Odyssey reinvented what movies could be. At twenty-two, Easy Rider showed America to itself—the freedom of the open road and the shotgun blast at the end. At twenty-five, The Godfather made organized crime into family saga. You watched the studio system die and something stranger, more personal, more dangerous take its place.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The transistor was invented at Bell Labs the same year you were born—December 1947, a few months after you arrived. Nobody understood what it meant yet. That tiny piece of germanium would eventually make computers small enough to hold in your hand, but in 1947, computers were room-sized behemoths that only the military and large corporations could afford. ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, had been unveiled the year before. It weighed 30 tons and filled an entire room. Your childhood would be thoroughly, magnificently analog.</p><p>At five, your household technology was mechanical and heavy. A black rotary phone—possibly a party line shared with neighbors who could listen in. A Maytag wringer washer. A Philco radio the size of a small dresser. If you were lucky, a Motorola or DuMont television with a screen no bigger than a lunch box. Everything took time to warm up, required maintenance, and was built to be repaired rather than replaced.</p><p>By ten, television had conquered America. You watched Gunsmoke and The Honeymooners on a set that your father had to adjust with pliers because the dial had broken off. The vertical hold drifted. The antenna needed constant repositioning. Snow and static were just part of the viewing experience. Yet it still felt like magic—moving pictures, in your living room, whenever you wanted them.</p><p>At nineteen, the first ATM appeared in London. At twenty-two, Texas Instruments introduced the pocket calculator—$150, roughly $1,100 in today's money, and it could only add, subtract, multiply, and divide. At twenty-nine, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were tinkering in a garage with something called the Apple I. You were in your thirties before personal computers existed, in your forties before they were common, in your fifties before the internet changed everything.</p><p>Your career was built on technologies that no longer exist. Carbon paper. Mimeograph machines. Dictaphones. Rolodexes. Filing cabinets stuffed with paper. You learned to type on manual typewriters where mistakes required correction fluid or starting over. The skills that made you competent in 1970—shorthand, filing systems, phone etiquette, the card catalog at the library—are now either extinct or transformed beyond recognition.</p><p>You've adapted to more technological change than any generation in human history. The world you were born into had propeller planes, party lines, and radio dramas. The world you're living in now has smartphones, video calls, and AI assistants. Some of your generation embraced each wave of change. Others resisted and got left behind. But you know something your grandchildren don't: you know what it was like before. You remember when information required effort, when entertainment required patience, when being unreachable was normal. That perspective isn't nostalgia. It's data.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were you on November 22, 1963? You were sixteen years old—a junior in high school, probably. Maybe sitting in algebra class, or at lunch, or walking between periods. Then the announcement came over the PA system, or a teacher walked in crying, or someone ran down the hall shouting that the President had been shot. You remember. Everyone your age remembers. JFK was dead at 46, and the country that had seemed so young and confident the day before suddenly felt fragile and old.</p><p>At seven, Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation unconstitutional. At eight, Emmett Till was murdered in Mississippi for allegedly whistling at a white woman. At eleven, nine Black students integrated Central High School in Little Rock while the National Guard and angry mobs surrounded them. You watched the civil rights movement unfold on television—fire hoses in Birmingham, the March on Washington, Selma. At seventeen, the Civil Rights Act passed. At eighteen, the Voting Rights Act. Progress was possible. Progress was bloody.</p><p>At twenty-one, everything shattered. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Bobby Kennedy was shot on June 5, two months later. The Democratic convention in Chicago turned into a police riot on live television. The Tet Offensive had already proved the Vietnam War was unwinnable. 1968 was the year America's optimism died, and you were exactly old enough to feel every blow.</p><p>At twenty-two, you watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. July 20, 1969. You probably watched it on a black-and-white television, maybe at a party, maybe with your family, maybe alone. Six hundred million people worldwide watched those grainy images, heard those words—'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' For one moment, in a year of assassinations and war, humanity had done something transcendent. You were there. You saw it happen.</p><p>Vietnam was the background music of your twenties. The draft lottery began when you were twenty-two—December 1, 1969, the first since World War II. Your birthday determined your fate. A low number meant you were going. A high number meant you were probably safe. Some of your friends went to Canada. Some went to Vietnam. Some came back different. Some came back in boxes. You were twenty-eight when the helicopters evacuated the embassy roof in Saigon. Fifty-eight thousand Americans dead. Three million Vietnamese. For what?</p><p>At twenty-seven, you watched Nixon resign—the first president to do so—rather than face impeachment for Watergate. The system works, people said. No one is above the law, people said. You were fifty-four on September 11, 2001, when that conviction was tested differently. Sixty-one during the 2008 financial collapse. Seventy-three when COVID-19 arrived, killing your generation at rates far higher than any other. You've witnessed more history than most generations see in several lifetimes. And history isn't done with you yet.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1969, with a college degree that cost perhaps $2,000 for four years at a state school, or maybe a high school diploma that was enough—genuinely enough—to get a job with a pension, health insurance, and a path to the middle class. The economy worked differently then. The social contract was intact. You worked hard, the company took care of you. That was the deal.</p><p>Your first job probably paid around $7,000 a year, which sounds laughable until you realize a new house cost $25,000 and a new car cost $3,500. The median family income when you started working was about $9,000—and on that income, a family of four could own a home, own a car, take vacations, and put money aside for retirement. One income. No student loans. A pension waiting at the end. Try explaining that to your grandchildren.</p><p>The '70s threw curveballs. The oil embargo in 1973. Stagflation—simultaneous inflation and unemployment that economists said couldn't happen. Gas lines. Layoffs. The golden postwar expansion sputtered. But you were young enough to adapt, established enough to weather it. You were in your thirties, building equity, climbing ladders that still existed.</p><p>The '80s changed the rules entirely. Reagan. Deregulation. The beginning of the end for unions. Shareholder value became the only value. The social contract your career was built on started to fray. But here's the thing: you'd gotten in early. You had seniority. You had a pension vesting. You had a house that was appreciating. The rules were changing for new workers, but the old rules still protected you.</p><p>If you were a man, you had advantages that were systematic and legal. If you were a woman, you entered a workforce that paid you 59 cents for every dollar a man made, that could fire you for getting pregnant, that assumed you'd quit when you got married. If you were Black, entire industries were closed to you, entire neighborhoods red-lined, entire paths blocked. The narrative of Boomer prosperity is true on average. Averages hide a lot.</p><p>Your generation rose to leadership during the great restructuring. You made the decisions about downsizing, outsourcing, offshoring. Maybe you fought those decisions. Maybe you made them. Maybe you just survived them. The economy that your children and grandchildren inherited—the gig economy, the at-will employment, the healthcare tied to jobs that can disappear overnight—was built during your tenure. You didn't build it alone, but you were in the room.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when asking someone out required walking up to them and using words? When getting their phone number meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer? When going steady meant something—a ring, a letterman jacket, a commitment that the whole school knew about? Dating had rituals in the 1960s. Rules. A structure that seems almost Victorian to people who can summon a date with a thumb swipe.</p><p>The pill changed everything. You were thirteen when the FDA approved oral contraception. By the time you were dating seriously, birth control was available—if you could find a doctor willing to prescribe it to an unmarried woman, which wasn't guaranteed. Free love was the countercultural promise, though the reality was more complicated. AIDS didn't arrive until 1981, when you were thirty-four. Your generation had a window—roughly 1965 to 1985—of sexual freedom between the pill and the plague that no generation before or since has experienced.</p><p>You probably married young by today's standards. The median age at first marriage in 1970 was 23 for men, 21 for women. By your mid-twenties, most of your friends were married, having kids, buying houses. The life timeline was compressed. You were expected to have your path set before you'd had time to figure out who you were. Some marriages lasted. Many didn't. Divorce rates doubled between 1960 and 1980, and your generation was on both sides of that equation—divorcing and being raised by divorced parents.</p><p>Long-distance relationships meant handwritten letters that took a week to arrive and three-minute phone calls that cost a dollar a minute. You learned to say things in writing that you might never say out loud. The slowness created its own intimacy—the anticipation of waiting, the weight of words committed to paper, the permanence of ink. Your grandchildren will never know what it's like to wait for a letter from someone they love.</p><p>Gender roles in your relationships shifted more dramatically than any generation before you. You entered adulthood when married women were expected to stop working, when husbands controlled the bank accounts, when 'marital rape' wasn't a legal concept. You're ending your life in a world where women outearn men in many households, where marriage is optional, where the rules you learned have been rewritten entirely. Some of you adapted. Some of you resisted. Some of you are still figuring it out.</p><p>Your friendships have thinned with time. The friends from high school, from your first job, from your kids' school—many have moved, faded, or died. Maintaining relationships now requires technologies you didn't grow up with. Your grandchildren text instead of call. Your children are busy in ways you don't fully understand. Connection requires effort it didn't used to require. The reward is the same—human contact, shared history, the comfort of being known—but the work has changed.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents remembered breadlines. They remembered losing everything in the Crash of 1929. They saved string, reused tinfoil, and never threw anything away because they knew—in their bones, not just their minds—that prosperity could evaporate overnight. You inherited that anxiety even as you inherited an economy that seemed to prove it wrong. The tension between Depression-era frugality and postwar abundance defined your relationship with money before you were old enough to earn any.</p><p>The numbers tell a story so stark it sounds like fiction. When you turned 22 in 1969, median household income was $9,400 and the median home price was $25,600—a ratio of roughly 2.7 to 1. By 2024, median household income is around $80,000 and median home price is $420,000—a ratio of over 5 to 1. You could buy a house on three years' income. Your grandchildren need six, assuming they can save anything at all.</p><p>Your generation's wealth accumulation rested on assets that appreciated beyond anyone's projections. The house you bought for $30,000 in 1975 is worth $400,000 now. The stock market, despite crashes in 1987, 2000, 2008, and 2020, has grown 4,000% since 1969. If you bought and held—if you didn't panic, didn't need to sell, didn't get divorced or laid off at the wrong time—you accumulated wealth just by existing. The math favored you in ways it no longer favors anyone.</p><p>But the narrative of universal Boomer prosperity is false. Plenty of your generation got divorced and lost half of everything. Got laid off in your fifties when nobody wanted to hire you. Got sick before Medicare kicked in. Made bad investments, or no investments. Trusted the wrong advisor. Had children who needed help, parents who needed care. The median Boomer household has retirement savings of around $200,000—which sounds like a lot until you realize it has to last potentially 30 years.</p><p>Healthcare is the variable that can bankrupt you. Even with Medicare, a serious illness can cost hundreds of thousands in uncovered expenses. Long-term care—nursing homes, assisted living, home health aides—costs $100,000 a year or more and isn't covered by Medicare. The median cost of a private room in a nursing home is now over $300 per day. Five years of that care would consume over half a million dollars. Everything you saved, everything you built, can disappear into medical bills.</p><p>The three-legged stool of retirement—Social Security, pensions, personal savings—has lost a leg. Your generation may be the last to receive meaningful pensions. Social Security faces funding shortfalls that politicians keep kicking down the road. Personal savings are supposed to carry the weight that institutions used to bear. You're living the transition, and there's no going back to the system that worked for your parents.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>The hardest thing to see is water when you're a fish. You worked hard, bought a house, built a career, saved for retirement. It worked. Effort led to reward. The system functioned. So when younger generations struggle with the same milestones, the natural assumption is they're not trying hard enough. But the water changed. The path you walked doesn't exist anymore—not because the path was easy, but because the economic landscape transformed after you crossed it.</p><p>Your generation talked about poverty, but often missed class. You could be poor and become not-poor through effort—that was true in the postwar economy, at least for white Americans. The structural barriers that keep people poor today—healthcare costs, childcare costs, housing costs, the credentialing requirements for jobs that didn't used to need credentials—are different from the barriers you faced. Advice that worked in 1975 doesn't work in 2025. Not because the advice was wrong, but because the economy changed.</p><p>Climate change is the blind spot your grandchildren will judge you for. Your generation knew. The science has been clear since the 1970s. You watched the warnings get ignored, the deadlines pass, the glaciers melt. Maybe you drove a Prius. Maybe you recycled. But as a generation, you prioritized immediate comfort over long-term survival. The bill is coming due, and you won't be here to pay it.</p><p>The digital world is not optional, and refusing to learn it isn't principled resistance—it's self-imposed isolation. Your grandchildren don't answer phone calls. Your doctors communicate through patient portals. Your bank wants you to use an app. The skills you need to navigate modern life require technology, and many in your generation have simply refused to acquire them. Some resistance is valid; some is stubbornness that costs you connection with people who communicate differently than you do.</p><p>And here's the sharpest truth: your generation protested. You marched against the war, demanded civil rights, questioned every institution your parents built. You were called naive, entitled, dangerous—exactly what you call younger generations now. The people who dismissed you were wrong. Is it possible you're wrong when you dismiss them? The kids questioning the economy, demanding climate action, rejecting the values you hold dear—they're doing exactly what you did at their age. The question is whether you can recognize your younger self in their anger.</p><p>None of this is a condemnation. Every generation has blind spots. Every generation fails to see what comes next. But self-awareness is possible at any age, and the alternative—certainty that you understand a world that has changed beyond recognition—isn't wisdom. It's calcification.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1967-1977):</strong> You turned 20 in 1967—the Summer of Love, the escalation in Vietnam, the year before everything cracked open. Your early twenties were chaos: assassinations, riots, the draft lottery, Woodstock, Kent State. You either went to Vietnam, went to Canada, went to college on a deferment, or got lucky with a high lottery number. You probably married young—the median was 23 for men, 21 for women. You started careers when a job was still a job, when companies still hired for decades, when pensions still existed.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1977-1987):</strong> The '70s hangover extended into your thirties. Stagflation. Gas lines. Watergate's aftermath. The hostage crisis in Iran. You were building families, buying houses, establishing careers while the economy lurched through oil shocks and recessions. Reagan arrived in 1981, and something fundamental shifted. You were 33 when 'Morning in America' became the slogan—old enough to have benefited from the old rules, young enough to adapt to the new ones. MTV launched when you were 34. AIDS emerged when you were 34 too. The party was over in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1987-1997):</strong> Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. Your children were teenagers, developing their own identities, rejecting yours. Your parents were aging, needing more. You were sandwiched between generations who both needed things from you. The Berlin Wall fell when you were 42. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were 44. The world you'd spent your life navigating—the Cold War, the nuclear threat, the East-West divide—simply ended. The internet arrived, though you probably encountered it first as a novelty, something the kids at work knew how to use.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (1997-2007):</strong> The dotcom boom and bust happened in your fifties. You watched younger colleagues get rich on paper, then watched the paper burn. At 54, you saw the towers fall—the defining trauma of a new century, though you'd already had your share of defining traumas. You were probably thinking about retirement: When could you afford to stop? What would you do with the time? How much was enough? The answers depended on choices made decades earlier, luck, and economic forces beyond your control.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2007-2017):</strong> The 2008 crash hit when you were 61. Maybe you'd already retired. Maybe you were planning to. Either way, you watched your 401(k) lose 40% of its value in months. Some of your generation worked longer than planned. Some couldn't find work at all. Some sold houses they'd paid off, moved to smaller places, adjusted expectations. The 'golden years' narrative didn't match the reality of a world that had stopped making sense.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2017-present):</strong> You've reached an age that used to mean slowing down, but your generation refuses to go quietly. COVID-19 hit you hardest statistically—your age group bore the highest death rates. You've navigated a pandemic, political polarization that echoes the '60s, and a digital world that wasn't built for you. You've seen more history than any generation alive. The world has changed beyond recognition. And here you are, still adapting, still witnessing, still here.</p>"

The Baby Boomer generation—all 76 million of you—was the largest generation in American history until Millennials narrowly overtook you. You reshaped every institution you touched: schools had to expand when you arrived, colleges couldn't build dorms fast enough, and Social Security started worrying when you began to retire. The sheer weight of your numbers bent the country around you.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They came of age during conformity—gray flannel suits, McCarthy hearings, trust in institutions that hadn't yet betrayed them. You came of age questioning everything. They fought in Korea without complaint; you fought in Vietnam or against it, loudly either way. They saved; you spent. They married once; you might have married twice or three times. They trust the news; you learned to be skeptical. They're quieter than you in every sense—smaller in number, smaller in volume, smaller in expectation.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They're your children, or they could be. They grew up as latchkey kids while you worked late. They watched you divorce, watched you chase careers, watched you change the rules and then complain when they didn't follow them. They're cynical where you were idealistic—they saw what happened to idealism. They're sandwiched between your massive generation and the equally massive Millennials, perpetually overlooked, and they seem fine with it. They don't trust institutions either, but they never expected to.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> The wealth gap between your generation and theirs is the starkest in recorded history. At age 35, Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age controlled 7%. You had pensions; they have student loans. The avocado toast jokes aren't funny to them. The math doesn't work, and they know it, and they're tired of being told to work harder by a generation that had it objectively easier.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You grew up with duck-and-cover drills for nuclear war; they grew up with active shooter drills for school shootings. You saw the moon landing; they've never known a world without the internet. They communicate in memes you don't understand. They're more diverse, more tolerant, more anxious, and more broke than any generation before. They view you with a mixture of bewilderment and resentment, and honestly, the resentment isn't entirely unfair. You inherited a better deal. You know it. They know it.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was 68 years. If you've made it to 77, actuarial tables give you another decade, maybe more. You're healthier in old age than your parents were—better medicine, better nutrition, less smoking. But healthcare costs can still bankrupt you, and the systems you're relying on for support are under more strain than they've ever been. You're living history's longest run. The view from here is complicated.</p>"
