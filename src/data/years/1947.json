      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You arrived the year the Cold War began in earnest. The Truman Doctrine committed America to containing communism worldwide. The Marshall Plan started pumping billions into rebuilding Europe. Your birth certificate might as well have been stamped with 'Made During Geopolitical Anxiety.'</p><p>Your childhood unfolded in the shadow of the bomb. Duck-and-cover drills taught you that nuclear annihilation could arrive at any moment, and the appropriate response was to hide under your desk. This was, in retrospect, insane. But it was also your normal. You learned early that the adults in charge didn't always have good answers.</p><p>The 1950s, which comprised most of your childhood, were sold as an era of conformity and prosperity. They were—if you were white, suburban, and willing to pretend the cracks weren't showing. McCarthyism made people afraid to speak. Segregation was law. The happy housewife mythology was crushing women. Underneath the Leave It to Beaver veneer, America was holding its breath.</p><p>You grew up without television initially, then watched it take over American living rooms. By the time you were ten, most families had one. You watched westerns, variety shows, and the news in black and white. The TV was furniture—a wooden cabinet you gathered around. It changed how families spent evenings, how politicians campaigned, and how you understood the world beyond your neighborhood.</p><p>Your toys were simpler. Erector sets. Lincoln Logs. Hula hoops when you were eleven. Play happened outside until the streetlights came on. You rode bikes without helmets, drank from garden hoses, and generally engaged in activities that would give modern parents heart palpitations. Somehow, most of you survived.</p><p>The Korean War started when you were three and ended when you were six. You probably don't remember it clearly, but it established the template: American troops fighting communism in faraway places, the draft a constant presence, victory never quite achieved. Sound familiar? This pattern would follow you for decades.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. You're part of the generation named after the population explosion that followed World War II. Your parents came home from the war, bought houses, had kids, and didn't stop having kids for almost twenty years. The result was 76 million of you—the largest generation America had ever seen.</p><p>Being born in 1947 makes you an early Boomer, part of the cohort that actually remembers the '50s and came of age during the '60s. You were old enough to be drafted for Vietnam, old enough to protest it, old enough to do both. The later Boomers, born in the late '50s and early '60s, had a different experience. By the time they came of age, the counterculture had been commodified and the draft had ended.</p><p>Your generation's defining narrative is complicated. You inherited the postwar prosperity, benefited from cheap education and housing, and built wealth during the longest economic expansion in American history. You also fought for civil rights, women's liberation, and environmental protection. You changed culture, politics, and social norms in ways that still reverberate.</p><p>But the narrative has soured. Your generation now controls most of the nation's wealth while younger generations struggle with debts, unaffordable housing, and disappearing pensions. The idealism of the '60s gave way to the Reagan era, which many of your cohort embraced enthusiastically. You went from questioning authority to becoming it, and not everyone likes what you did with the power.</p><p>This isn't entirely fair. Generations don't act as monoliths. Plenty of Boomers stayed radical, stayed broke, stayed on the margins. But the stereotype persists: the generation that pulled up the ladder behind them. Whether you personally climbed that ladder or were left at the bottom, the perception shapes how younger generations see you.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier, stepping onto the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers and changing American sports forever. You were two months old when he played his first game. The integration of baseball preceded Brown v. Board of Education by seven years. Sports led where law followed.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack was the transition from big band to rock and roll. You were seven when Elvis appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, filmed from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous for America. You were there for the birth of an entire musical revolution—Bill Haley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Buddy Holly. The music your parents found scandalous became the template for everything that followed.</p><p>Television shaped your generation more than any medium before. You watched I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, and Gunsmoke. You saw JFK debate Nixon in 1960 and understood, maybe before anyone articulated it, that television would change politics forever. Kennedy looked good on screen. Nixon sweated. The future belonged to whoever mastered the new medium.</p><p>By your teenage years, pop culture had exploded. The Beatles arrived when you were sixteen, and nothing was quite the same after. You were nineteen during the Summer of Love. Twenty-two for Woodstock. Your generation's music—Dylan, the Stones, Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Who—wasn't just entertainment. It was identity, politics, and tribal belonging all mixed together.</p><p>The movies of your youth ranged from wholesome (The Sound of Music) to revolutionary (Bonnie and Clyde, Easy Rider). You watched Hollywood's old studio system collapse and something rawer emerge. By the time you were in your twenties, movies could show things that would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. The culture was cracking open, and you were there for it.</p><p>Your relationship with pop culture is different from later generations. You didn't have infinite choice. You watched what was on, listened to what was playing, read what was available. Scarcity created shared experiences. Everyone saw the same Ed Sullivan episode. Everyone knew the same songs. This made culture feel more communal, even if it also meant gatekeepers had enormous power over what got seen and heard.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the transistor was invented at Bell Labs, though nobody knew yet what that tiny piece of semiconductor would mean. The transistor replaced the vacuum tube and made everything that followed possible—computers small enough to fit on desks, then in pockets, then everywhere. Your birth coincided with the foundation of the digital age, even if you spent your childhood in a thoroughly analog world.</p><p>Your childhood technology was mechanical. Rotary phones. Manual typewriters. Cars with stick shifts and no seatbelts. Televisions that took thirty seconds to warm up. Air conditioning was a luxury. Your family might have had a party line phone, sharing the circuit with neighbors who could listen in if they wanted.</p><p>You were nineteen when the first ATM appeared, twenty-two when pocket calculators hit the market, twenty-nine when Apple released the first personal computer. You watched technology transform from room-sized mainframes to something you could theoretically afford. Most of these early computers were expensive toys, but the trajectory was clear to anyone paying attention.</p><p>The internet didn't exist for most of your working life. You communicated by phone, fax, and memo. Research meant libraries. Information moved slowly. When you needed to look something up, you physically went somewhere or called someone who might know. This sounds primitive to younger generations, but it also meant you developed skills they haven't—the ability to work without instant answers, to think through problems without Google.</p><p>You've had to adapt to more technological change than almost any generation in history. You learned to use computers in your forties or fifties, smartphones in your sixties. Some of your cohort embraced it eagerly. Others resisted and got left behind. The digital divide within your generation is substantial—some Boomers are more online than their grandchildren, while others still print their emails.</p><p>What you bring that younger generations don't: the memory of how things worked before. You know that democracy functioned without social media, that relationships existed without dating apps, that people found information without search engines. This perspective is valuable. The old ways weren't always worse. Sometimes they were just different.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three when North Korea invaded South Korea. Six when the Korean War ended in an armistice that still hasn't been replaced with a peace treaty. Seven when Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation unconstitutional—though implementation would take decades and is still incomplete.</p><p>You were sixteen when JFK was assassinated in Dallas. You remember where you were. Everyone your age does. The youngest president in American history, killed on live television. The Warren Commission blamed a lone gunman. Nobody quite believed it. The conspiracy theories started immediately and never stopped.</p><p>You were seventeen when the Civil Rights Act passed, eighteen during the Voting Rights Act. The movements of the early '60s had achieved legislative victories. But then came the backlash: Watts in 1965, riots in dozens of cities, white flight to the suburbs, Nixon's Southern Strategy. Progress met resistance, as it always does.</p><p>You were twenty-one when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated within two months of each other. 1968 was a year of chaos—the Tet Offensive, the Democratic convention in Chicago, Nixon's election. The optimism of the early decade had curdled into something darker. You entered adulthood in a country that felt like it was coming apart.</p><p>You were twenty-two when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Neil Armstrong's 'one small step' was the brightest moment in a dark stretch. America had done the impossible. For one afternoon, the country felt unified. It wouldn't last, but you were there, watching on a television set, part of the largest audience in human history up to that point.</p><p>Vietnam shadowed your entire early adulthood. The draft lottery started when you were twenty-two. Friends, brothers, and classmates went to Southeast Asia. Some came back different. Some didn't come back at all. You were twenty-six when the last American troops left Saigon, twenty-eight when the helicopters evacuated the embassy roof. Fifty-eight thousand Americans dead. Three million Vietnamese. For what?</p><p>Watergate consumed your late twenties. You watched Nixon's lies unravel on live television. You were twenty-seven when he resigned rather than face impeachment. The lesson was supposed to be that the system works, that no one is above the law. Later events would complicate that interpretation considerably.</p><p>You were fifty-four during 9/11, sixty-one during the 2008 financial crisis, seventy-three when COVID-19 arrived. History didn't stop when you reached middle age. If anything, it accelerated. You've lived through more destabilizing moments than most generations, and you're still here, still adapting, still trying to make sense of a world that keeps changing faster than anyone can process.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1969, which was simultaneously a terrible time (Vietnam, social upheaval, assassinations) and an excellent time (strong unions, affordable housing, pensions that actually existed). The economy worked differently then. A high school diploma could get you a middle-class job. A college degree, if you had one, cost a fraction of current tuition and almost guaranteed employment.</p><p>Your career unfolded during the golden age of American labor. Benefits were real. Retirement plans had actual guaranteed payouts. Companies hired people expecting to employ them for decades. The social contract between workers and employers hadn't yet been shredded by shareholder capitalism and 'at-will employment.'</p><p>You probably worked for fewer companies than your children will. Job-hopping was unusual, even suspect. Loyalty was expected and, for a while, rewarded. You climbed ladders, paid your dues, and eventually reached positions of authority. The system made sense, even if it was far from fair—women and minorities faced barriers that were systematic, legal, and enforced.</p><p>The '70s brought stagflation, oil shocks, and economic uncertainty. The '80s brought Reagan, deregulation, and the beginning of the trends that would gut the middle class. You were in your thirties and forties during these decades—old enough to be established, young enough to adapt. Many in your generation thrived. The rules were changing, but you'd gotten in early enough to benefit from the old rules while they still applied.</p><p>You reached peak earning years just as the economy was being restructured to favor capital over labor. Whether you benefited from this or got crushed by it depended on factors largely beyond your control: industry, geography, race, gender, luck. The narrative that all Boomers prospered is false. Plenty were downsized, outsourced, and discarded. But enough accumulated wealth to make the generational statistics stark.</p><p>Retirement, if you've reached it, looks different than your parents' version. You're likely living longer, which means savings have to stretch further. Social Security is under constant political threat. Healthcare costs could bankrupt you despite Medicare. The security your generation was promised has eroded, even if you're better positioned than those coming behind you.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which means your generation's relationship with intimacy is more complicated than the '50s stereotypes suggest. The pill became available when you were thirteen. Free love was a countercultural ideal by the time you were twenty. AIDS didn't emerge until you were thirty-four. Your generation had a window of sexual freedom that later generations didn't experience the same way.</p><p>You probably married earlier than Millennials or Gen Z. The median age at first marriage for men in 1970 was 23; for women, 21. If you followed the pattern, you were a spouse before you were a full adult, by today's standards. Divorce rates climbed throughout your adulthood—no-fault divorce became available in most states during the '70s—which meant many in your generation remarried, sometimes multiple times.</p><p>Communication in your relationships happened face-to-face, by phone, and by letter. You wrote actual letters, sealed them in envelopes, put stamps on them, and waited days or weeks for responses. Long-distance relationships required commitment, scheduling, and significant phone bills. The slowness of communication created different rhythms—more patience, more anticipation, less constant contact.</p><p>Gender roles in relationships shifted dramatically during your lifetime. You entered adulthood when women were expected to quit work after marriage. You're reaching old age with women comprising half the workforce. The marriages that worked adapted to these changes. The ones that didn't ended. Your generation navigated these shifts in real-time, often without models for what egalitarian partnership looked like.</p><p>Parenting norms transformed too. Your parents practiced benign neglect by current standards—kids roamed free, discipline was physical, emotional expression was limited. You probably parented differently than you were parented, though whether that meant more involvement, more communication, or just different anxieties varied by individual. You raised the Gen X and Millennial generations, and they have opinions about how you did.</p><p>Now, in later life, your relationships have likely simplified. Friends have died. Family structures have changed. Grandchildren, if you have them, connect you to generations whose lives look nothing like yours. You've had to learn new communication tools—texting, video calls, social media—to stay in touch with people who don't answer phones anymore.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by parents who survived the Depression and World War II. Frugality was a virtue. Debt was shameful, except for mortgages. Saving was automatic. You absorbed these values even as the consumer economy encouraged spending. The tension between your parents' scarcity mindset and postwar abundance defined your generation's complicated relationship with money.</p><p>You benefited from historical timing in ways younger generations envy. Housing was affordable when you bought. Education was cheap or free. Pensions existed. Social Security was solvent. The wealth-building mechanisms that created the American middle class were functional and accessible—if you were white. If you weren't, discriminatory lending, housing covenants, and hiring practices meant these advantages were partially or completely unavailable.</p><p>Inflation in the '70s taught you that money could lose value rapidly. The 13% inflation of 1980 eroded savings and changed behavior. You learned to expect raises that at least matched inflation. You learned that fixed incomes were traps. These lessons stuck, even as inflation moderated and deflationary pressures emerged.</p><p>Your generation's retirement planning was supposed to rest on a three-legged stool: Social Security, pensions, and personal savings. The pension leg has collapsed for most workers. Social Security faces political and demographic pressures. Personal savings, if you accumulated them, carry the entire weight. The system you planned for is not the system that exists.</p><p>Stock market crashes have punctuated your financial life—1987, 2000, 2008, 2020. If you stayed invested through the volatility, you've probably done well. Markets recovered and exceeded previous highs. But many in your generation panicked, sold at lows, and never recovered. The psychological damage of watching retirement savings evaporate doesn't heal just because markets eventually recovered.</p><p>Healthcare costs are your generation's financial wildcard. Even with Medicare, a serious illness can drain assets accumulated over a lifetime. Long-term care insurance is expensive if you can get it at all. The prospect of needing nursing home care—which can cost six figures annually—looms over financial planning. Many in your generation will spend their final years spending down everything they built.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's most persistent blind spot is the assumption that your experience was typical. You bought houses on single incomes because that was possible then. You paid for college with summer jobs because tuition was that low. You built wealth because the economy rewarded your effort in ways it no longer does. Telling younger people to work harder misses the structural changes that made your path unavailable.</p><p>The environmental bill for your prosperity is coming due. Your generation's consumption patterns—bigger cars, bigger houses, more stuff—accelerated climate change in ways that future generations will pay for. This isn't unique to Boomers; previous generations industrialized and polluted too. But the scale expanded during your lifetime, and the warnings came early enough that more aggressive action was possible.</p><p>Technology is a genuine blind spot for many in your cohort. Not using email, not understanding smartphones, not grasping how social media works—these aren't charming eccentricities. They're barriers to participation in modern life. The world has moved online. Refusing to follow means missing information, opportunities, and connection. Some resistance is principled. Some is just stubbornness.</p><p>Your generation's relationship with work can be difficult for younger workers to navigate. The expectation that people should be grateful for jobs, should pay dues, should not expect work-life balance—these assumptions shaped workplaces your generation built and still often leads. But the economic conditions that justified loyalty to employers have evaporated. Expecting the same commitment from workers who receive no reciprocal loyalty isn't reasonable.</p><p>Race remains a charged topic. Your generation includes both civil rights heroes and people who opposed integration every step of the way. The assumption that racism ended with legal segregation—that the '60s solved the problem—ignores how discrimination adapted, went underground, and persisted in policing, lending, hiring, and housing. Your generation made progress and declared victory too soon.</p><p>Finally, the tendency to view generational conflict as young people being soft or entitled ignores what you faced at their age. You protested. You questioned authority. You were called naive, idealistic, dangerous. Now some of your cohort deploys the same dismissals against younger generations raising the same kinds of concerns. History rhymes, and self-awareness should too.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You came of age during the most turbulent period in American history since the Civil War. Vietnam. Assassinations. The counterculture and the backlash against it. You either got drafted, got deferred, or got lucky. You marched for civil rights or worried about what all that marching meant. You probably married young by current standards. You started careers in an economy that still made sense, where a job could become a career could become a pension.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> The '70s were harder than the American dream promised. Stagflation. Oil shocks. Watergate. Vietnam's bitter end. The idealism of the '60s had curdled. You were probably building families, buying houses if you could afford them, climbing career ladders. Disco came and went. Punk arrived. The culture was fragmenting into niches that would only multiply.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Reagan reshaped America during these years. You were established enough to benefit from tax cuts if you had money, hurt by deregulation if you didn't. The Cold War intensified before it suddenly ended. AIDS devastated communities while the government ignored it. You were raising teenagers who would be called Generation X, the latchkey kids who seemed so cynical compared to your youthful idealism.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> The '90s brought peace and prosperity—or at least the appearance of both. The Soviet Union had collapsed. The economy boomed. The internet arrived, though you probably viewed it as a novelty rather than a revolution. Clinton was impeached over lies about sex, which seemed like the biggest scandal possible until bigger ones came. You were peak earners now, peak influence, peak power. Your generation ran things.</p><p><strong>Your 60s ({{SIXTIES_START}}-2007):</strong> You entered this decade with 9/11, which changed everything about America's relationship with the world and with itself. You were probably thinking about retirement when the 2008 crash vaporized savings, home values, and certainties. Some of your cohort retired anyway. Some couldn't afford to. Some lost jobs and found themselves unemployed at an age when nobody wanted to hire them.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2017+):</strong> You're watching a country that looks less and less like the one you grew up in. The political polarization echoes the '60s but feels different—more entrenched, more mediated, more constant. COVID-19 hit your generation hardest, statistically. You're navigating health concerns, financial anxieties, family responsibilities, and a digital world that wasn't built for you. You've seen more history than most. You'll see more still.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.8 million people born in 1947. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US, the largest generation until Millennials briefly overtook you. You're now dying faster than younger generations are being born, which is simply what happens when a generation ages.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were louder, more rebellious, and more numerous. They came of age during conformity and McCarthy; you came of age during protest and counterculture. They trusted institutions; you questioned them. They saved and scrimped; you consumed and borrowed. They fought in Korea; you fought in Vietnam or against it.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had it easier economically but harder culturally. Gen X grew up as latchkey kids while you were at work building careers. They're cynical where you were idealistic. They had fewer children, divorced at similar rates, and arrived at middle age just as the economy was collapsing. They're sandwiched between your massive cohort and the equally large Millennials, perpetually overlooked and probably fine with that.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the economic disparity is stark. Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth at age 35. Millennials control 7%. You bought houses that have appreciated enormously. They rent indefinitely. You had pensions. They have student debt. The structural advantages you received are not available to them, regardless of how hard they work or how many side hustles they maintain.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. They've never known a world without smartphones, social media, or school shootings. They're more diverse, more tolerant, more anxious, and more digital than any generation before. They communicate in memes. They organize online. They view your generation with a mixture of bewilderment and resentment that isn't entirely fair but isn't entirely unfounded either.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 68 years, though if you've made it to 77, you'll likely live into your mid-to-late 80s. Your generation is healthier in old age than previous generations were—better medicine, better nutrition, better knowledge about what kills you. But you're also facing chronic conditions, cognitive decline, and healthcare costs that can consume everything you've saved.</p><p>What you've witnessed is unparalleled: the Civil Rights Movement, the moon landing, Watergate, the fall of the Soviet Union, 9/11, the smartphone revolution, a global pandemic. No generation has seen this much change this fast. That experience is valuable, even when younger generations don't want to hear about it.</p>"
