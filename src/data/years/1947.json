      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1947-1959</h2><p>Children born in 1947 arrived into the second year of the baby boom, when the birth surge was no longer a surprise but a condition. Hospitals had adjusted. The nation had not. Their fathers were a year further from the war than the '46 cohort, settled enough to have jobs and mortgages but still carrying what the war had done to them in ways the family didn't discuss. The house might be new — a Cape Cod or ranch in one of the developments spreading across former farmland — and the neighborhood was full of families exactly like theirs: young, fertile, and determined to build something normal.</p><p>The domestic architecture of this childhood was remarkably uniform. Father left for work. Mother stayed home. Children were abundant — three, four, five per household was common — and the neighborhood absorbed the overflow. Backyards connected. Screen doors slammed. Kids moved in loose packs from yard to yard, supervised by whichever mother happened to be looking out the kitchen window. Formal childcare didn't exist because the entire block functioned as an informal one. A skinned knee got treated at the nearest house. Discipline could come from any adult within earshot.</p><p>School in the early 1950s operated on a philosophy of conformity that would alarm modern parents. Rows of desks bolted to the floor. Penmanship drills. The Pledge of Allegiance every morning, hand over heart, without irony or opt-out. At six, the classroom introduced duck-and-cover — a civil defense drill premised on the idea that a school desk could protect a child from a nuclear blast. The teachers delivered these instructions matter-of-factly, as if preparing for atomic war were as routine as a fire drill. Children absorbed the contradiction between the cheerful normalcy of their daily lives and the possibility that all of it could vanish in a flash, and they carried that contradiction quietly, the way children do.</p><p>Polio was the other specter. Every summer, anxiety spiked — parents monitored their children for fevers, kept them from public swimming pools, watched for the telltale signs. Everyone knew a family that had been touched by it. At eight, the Salk vaccine changed everything. Children lined up in school cafeterias, received their injections, and a fear that had darkened every summer of their short lives simply lifted. The relief was so total, so immediate, that it became a formative lesson in what science could accomplish when aimed at the right problem.</p><p>What defined this childhood more than any single event was its strange duality: material comfort and existential uncertainty, side by side. These children ate well, lived in houses their parents owned, attended schools that were being built as fast as the districts could fund them. They also grew up understanding, at a level too deep for language, that the entire arrangement was provisional — that the Soviets had the bomb, that the world's adults were frightened, and that the prosperous surface of 1950s American life rested on ground that might, at any moment, give way.</p>"

The term was coined for the population explosion that began nine months after V-J Day, when this generation's fathers came home from Europe and the Pacific with one thing on their minds. Boomers was part of the first wave—born in 1947, the second year of the boom—and there were <span class=\"stat-box\">3.8 million</span> of this generation that year alone. This generation's parents didn't stop there. They kept having babies until 1964, producing <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> of this generation, the largest generation America had ever seen.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers was sixteen when JFK was shot in Dallas. November 22, 1963. Boomers was probably in class when the announcement came over the PA system.</span> Eighteen during the Watts riots. Twenty when the Summer of Love promised to change everything. Twenty-two at Woodstock—old enough to have been there, young enough to still believe in what it represented. This generation's generation didn't just witness the '60s; this generation was its foot soldiers, its protesters, its casualties, and eventually, its inheritors.</p><p>Being an early Boomer meant something different than being a late one. Boomers actually remember Eisenhower. Boomers watched the '50s unfold from inside them, not from textbooks. When Vietnam came, this generation was draft age—not too young to worry about it, not old enough to have already served. The lottery number this generation drew, or didn't, shaped the rest of this generation's life. Some of this generation's high school classmates came home in boxes. Others came home different. Others didn't go at all and carry different kinds of weight.</p><p>This generation's generation's story has two chapters that don't quite connect. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Chapter one: this generation marched for civil rights, protested an immoral war, demanded equality for women, and questioned every institution this generation's parents had built. Chapter two: this generation voted for Reagan, dismantled the safety net, accumulated more wealth than any generation in history, and told this generation's children they weren't working hard enough.</span> Both chapters are true. Both are incomplete.</p><p>This generation's generation's defining contradiction: this generation questioned everything, then became the establishment this generation once challenged. The '60s taught this generation to distrust authority. The decades that followed made this generation the authority. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Whether this generation personally embraced that transformation or fought it, the pattern defines how younger generations see this generation. Fair or not, this generation're the generation that got the ladder and then—the narrative goes—pulled it up.</p>"

This cohort didn't understand it then—this cohort couldn't—but this cohort grew up in a country that was different because of what happened that April. Robinson took the abuse, the death threats, the spikings, and the hotels that wouldn't let him stay with his teammates. Baseball integrated seven years before public schools did. Sometimes sports leads where law is afraid to go.</p><p>At six, this cohort gathered around the radio with 82 million other Americans to hear Bobby Thomson's 'Shot Heard Round the World'—the Giants winning the pennant on a ninth-inning home run. At seven, I Love Lucy premiered, and suddenly everyone knew who Lucy and Desi were, what they were doing Monday nights, and why Lucy was always scheming. At eight, this cohort watched the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the first global television event—2 million Americans saw it live, and this cohort's family might have been among them, clustered around a neighbor's tiny screen.</p><p>The music of this cohort's childhood was Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Patti Page, and the Ames Brothers—smooth, safe, sponsored by cigarette companies. Then at nine, 'Rock Around the Clock' played over the credits of Blackboard Jungle, and something cracked open. At eleven, Elvis Presley appeared on Ed Sullivan, filmed from the waist up because his hips were obscene. At twelve, American Bandstand went national, and suddenly teenagers had their own music, their own dances, their own culture that parents didn't understand and couldn't control.</p><p>This cohort's teenage years were soundtracked by the birth of rock and roll. Buddy Holly and the Crickets. Little Richard screaming 'Tutti Frutti.' Chuck Berry duck-walking across stages. The Everly Brothers harmonizing about waking up. Ritchie Valens with 'La Bamba.' Then the plane crash—this cohort was eleven when Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper died in an Iowa cornfield. The Day the Music Died. This cohort remember exactly where this cohort was when this cohort heard.</p><p>At sixteen, the Beatles landed at JFK Airport and appeared on Ed Sullivan, and 73 million people watched—the largest television audience in American history at that point. At seventeen, Dylan went electric at Newport and got booed by folk purists. At nineteen, the Summer of Love promised peace and understanding. At twenty-two, this cohort was the right age for Woodstock—half a million people in a muddy field, Hendrix playing the 'Star-Spangled Banner' at dawn, the counterculture's high-water mark before the tide went out.</p><p>The movies of this cohort's youth shifted from Doris Day to Dennis Hopper. At nineteen, Bonnie and Clyde reinvented screen violence. At twenty-one, 2001: A Space Odyssey reinvented what movies could be. At twenty-two, Easy Rider showed America to itself—the freedom of the open road and the shotgun blast at the end. At twenty-five, The Godfather made organized crime into family saga. This cohort watched the studio system die and something stranger, more personal, more dangerous take its place.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>This cohort's Technology Timeline</h2><p>The transistor was invented at Bell Labs the same year this cohort was born—December 1947, a few months after this cohort arrived. Nobody understood what it meant yet. That tiny piece of germanium would eventually make computers small enough to hold in this cohort's hand, but in 1947, computers were room-sized behemoths that only the military and large corporations could afford. ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, had been unveiled the year before. It weighed 30 tons and filled an entire room. This cohort's childhood would be thoroughly, magnificently analog.</p><p>At five, this cohort's household technology was mechanical and heavy. A black rotary phone—possibly a party line shared with neighbors who could listen in. A Maytag wringer washer. A Philco radio the size of a small dresser. If this cohort was lucky, a Motorola or DuMont television with a screen no bigger than a lunch box. Everything took time to warm up, required maintenance, and was built to be repaired rather than replaced.</p><p>By ten, television had conquered America. This cohort watched Gunsmoke and The Honeymooners on a set that this cohort's father had to adjust with pliers because the dial had broken off. The vertical hold drifted. The antenna needed constant repositioning. Snow and static were just part of the viewing experience. Yet it still felt like magic—moving pictures, in this cohort's living room, whenever this cohort wanted them.</p><p>At nineteen, the first ATM appeared in London. At twenty-two, Texas Instruments introduced the pocket calculator—$150, roughly $1,100 in today's money, and it could only add, subtract, multiply, and divide. At twenty-nine, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were tinkering in a garage with something called the Apple I. This cohort were in this cohort's thirties before personal computers existed, in this cohort's forties before they were common, in this cohort's fifties before the internet changed everything.</p><p>This cohort's career was built on technologies that no longer exist. Carbon paper. Mimeograph machines. Dictaphones. Rolodexes. Filing cabinets stuffed with paper. This cohort learned to type on manual typewriters where mistakes required correction fluid or starting over. The skills that made this cohort competent in 1970—shorthand, filing systems, phone etiquette, the card catalog at the library—are now either extinct or transformed beyond recognition.</p><p>This cohort've adapted to more technological change than any generation in human history. The world this cohort was born into had propeller planes, party lines, and radio dramas. The world this cohort're living in now has smartphones, video calls, and AI assistants. Some of this cohort's generation embraced each wave of change. Others resisted and got left behind. But this cohort know something this cohort's grandchildren don't: this cohort know what it was like before. This cohort remember when information required effort, when entertainment required patience, when being unreachable was normal. That perspective isn't nostalgia. It's data.</p>"

Maybe sitting in algebra class, or at lunch, or walking between periods. Then the announcement came over the PA system, or a teacher walked in crying, or someone ran down the hall shouting that the President had been shot.</span> This cohort remember. Everyone this cohort's age remembers. JFK was dead at 46, and the country that had seemed so young and confident the day before suddenly felt fragile and old.</p><p>At seven, Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation unconstitutional. At eight, Emmett Till was murdered in Mississippi for allegedly whistling at a white woman. At eleven, nine Black students integrated Central High School in Little Rock while the National Guard and angry mobs surrounded them. This cohort watched the civil rights movement unfold on television—fire hoses in Birmingham, the March on Washington, Selma. At seventeen, the Civil Rights Act passed. At eighteen, the Voting Rights Act. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Progress was possible. Progress was bloody.</span></p><p>At twenty-one, everything shattered. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Bobby Kennedy was shot on June 5, two months later. The Democratic convention in Chicago turned into a police riot on live television. The Tet Offensive had already proved the Vietnam War was unwinnable. <span class=\"pull-quote\">1968 was the year America's optimism died, and this cohort was exactly old enough to feel every blow.</span></p><p>At twenty-two, this cohort watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. July 20, 1969. This cohort probably watched it on a black-and-white television, maybe at a party, maybe with this cohort's family, maybe alone. Six hundred million people worldwide watched those grainy images, heard those words—'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' For one moment, in a year of assassinations and war, humanity had done something transcendent. This cohort were there. This cohort saw it happen.</p><p>Vietnam was the background music of this cohort's twenties. The draft lottery began when this cohort was twenty-two—December 1, 1969, the first since World War II. This cohort's birthday determined this cohort's fate. A low number meant this cohort was going. A high number meant this cohort was probably safe. Some of this cohort's friends went to Canada. Some went to Vietnam. Some came back different. Some came back in boxes. This cohort were twenty-eight when the helicopters evacuated the embassy roof in Saigon. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans dead. Three million Vietnamese. For what?</p><p>At twenty-seven, this cohort watched Nixon resign—the first president to do so—rather than face impeachment for Watergate. The system works, people said. No one is above the law, people said. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At sixty-one during the 2008 financial collapse. Seventy-three when COVID-19 arrived, killing this cohort's generation at rates far higher than any other. This cohort've witnessed more history than most generations see in several lifetimes. And history isn't done with this cohort yet.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>This cohort entered the workforce around 1969, with a college degree that cost perhaps <span class=\"stat-box\">$2,000</span> for four years at a state school, or maybe a high school diploma that was enough—genuinely enough—to get a job with a pension, health insurance, and a path to the middle class. The economy worked differently then. The social contract was intact. This cohort worked hard, the company took care of this cohort. That was the deal.</p><p>This cohort's first job probably paid around <span class=\"stat-box\">$7,000</span> a year, which sounds laughable until this cohort realize a new house cost <span class=\"stat-box\">$25,000</span> and a new car cost <span class=\"stat-box\">$3,500</span>. The median family income when this cohort started working was about $9,000—and on that income, a family of four could own a home, own a car, take vacations, and put money aside for retirement. One income. No student loans. A pension waiting at the end. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Try explaining that to this cohort's grandchildren.</span></p><p>The '70s threw curveballs. The oil embargo in 1973. Stagflation—simultaneous inflation and unemployment that economists said couldn't happen. Gas lines. Layoffs. The golden postwar expansion sputtered. But this cohort was young enough to adapt, established enough to weather it. This cohort were in this cohort's thirties, building equity, climbing ladders that still existed.</p><p>The '80s changed the rules entirely. Reagan. Deregulation. The beginning of the end for unions. Shareholder value became the only value. The social contract this cohort's career was built on started to fray. But here's the thing: this cohort'd gotten in early. This cohort had seniority. This cohort had a pension vesting. This cohort had a house that was appreciating. The rules were changing for new workers, but the old rules still protected this cohort.</p><p>If this cohort was a man, this cohort had advantages that were systematic and legal. If this cohort was a woman, this cohort entered a workforce that paid this cohort 59 cents for every dollar a man made, that could fire this cohort for getting pregnant, that assumed this cohort'd quit when this cohort got married. If this cohort was Black, entire industries were closed to this cohort, entire neighborhoods red-lined, entire paths blocked. The narrative of Boomer prosperity is true on average. Averages hide a lot.</p><p>This cohort's generation rose to leadership during the great restructuring. This cohort made the decisions about downsizing, outsourcing, offshoring. Maybe this cohort fought those decisions. Maybe this cohort made them. Maybe this cohort just survived them. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and this cohort watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> The economy that this cohort's children and grandchildren inherited—the gig economy, the at-will employment, the healthcare tied to jobs that can disappear overnight—was built during this cohort's tenure. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This cohort didn't build it alone, but this cohort was in the room.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when asking someone out required walking up to them and using words? When getting their phone number meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer? When going steady meant something—a ring, a letterman jacket, a commitment that the whole school knew about? Dating had rituals in the 1960s. Rules. A structure that seems almost Victorian to people who can summon a date with a thumb swipe.</p><p>The pill changed everything. Boomers was thirteen when the FDA approved oral contraception. By the time this generation was dating seriously, birth control was available—if this generation could find a doctor willing to prescribe it to an unmarried woman, which wasn't guaranteed. Free love was the countercultural promise, though the reality was more complicated. AIDS didn't arrive until 1981, when this generation was thirty-four. This generation's generation had a window—roughly 1965 to 1985—of sexual freedom between the pill and the plague that no generation before or since has experienced.</p><p>Boomers probably married young by today's standards. The median age at first marriage in 1970 was 23 for men, 21 for women. By this generation's mid-twenties, most of this generation's friends were married, having kids, buying houses. The life timeline was compressed. Boomers was expected to have this generation's path set before this generation'd had time to figure out who this generation was. Some marriages lasted. Many didn't. Divorce rates doubled between 1960 and 1980, and this generation's generation was on both sides of that equation—divorcing and being raised by divorced parents.</p><p>Long-distance relationships meant handwritten letters that took a week to arrive and three-minute phone calls that cost a dollar a minute. Boomers learned to say things in writing that this generation might never say out loud. The slowness created its own intimacy—the anticipation of waiting, the weight of words committed to paper, the permanence of ink. This generation's grandchildren will never know what it's like to wait for a letter from someone they love.</p><p>Gender roles in this generation's relationships shifted more dramatically than any generation before this generation. Boomers entered adulthood when married women were expected to stop working, when husbands controlled the bank accounts, when 'marital rape' wasn't a legal concept. Boomers're ending this generation's life in a world where women outearn men in many households, where marriage is optional, where the rules this generation learned have been rewritten entirely. Some of this generation adapted. Some of this generation resisted. Some of this generation are still figuring it out.</p><p>This generation's friendships have thinned with time. The friends from high school, from this generation's first job, from this generation's kids' school—many have moved, faded, or died. Maintaining relationships now requires technologies this generation didn't grow up with. This generation's grandchildren text instead of call. This generation's children are busy in ways this generation don't fully understand. Connection requires effort it didn't used to require. The reward is the same—human contact, shared history, the comfort of being known—but the work has changed.</p>"

They saved string, reused tinfoil, and never threw anything away because they knew—in their bones, not just their minds—that prosperity could evaporate overnight. This cohort inherited that anxiety even as this cohort inherited an economy that seemed to prove it wrong. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The tension between Depression-era frugality and postwar abundance defined this cohort's relationship with money before this cohort was old enough to earn any.</span></p><p>The numbers tell a story so stark it sounds like fiction. When this cohort turned 22 in 1969, median household income was <span class=\"stat-box\">$9,400</span> and the median home price was <span class=\"stat-box\">$25,600</span>—a ratio of roughly 2.7 to 1. By 2024, median household income is around <span class=\"stat-box\">$80,000</span> and median home price is <span class=\"stat-box\">$420,000</span>—a ratio of over 5 to 1. <span class=\"hero-callout\">This cohort could buy a house on three years' income. This cohort's grandchildren need six, assuming they can save anything at all.</span></p><p>This cohort's generation's wealth accumulation rested on assets that appreciated beyond anyone's projections. The house this cohort bought for $30,000 in 1975 is worth $400,000 now. The stock market, despite crashes in 1987, 2000, 2008, and 2020, has grown 4,000% since 1969. If this cohort bought and held—if this cohort didn't panic, didn't need to sell, didn't get divorced or laid off at the wrong time—this cohort accumulated wealth just by existing. The math favored this cohort in ways it no longer favors anyone.</p><p>But the narrative of universal Boomer prosperity is false. Plenty of this cohort's generation got divorced and lost half of everything. Got laid off in this cohort's fifties when nobody wanted to hire this cohort. Got sick before Medicare kicked in. Made bad investments, or no investments. Trusted the wrong advisor. Had children who needed help, parents who needed care. The median Boomer household has retirement savings of around $200,000—which sounds like a lot until this cohort realize it has to last potentially 30 years.</p><p>Healthcare is the variable that can bankrupt this cohort. Even with Medicare, a serious illness can cost hundreds of thousands in uncovered expenses. Long-term care—nursing homes, assisted living, home health aides—costs <span class=\"stat-box\">$100,000 a year</span> or more and isn't covered by Medicare. The median cost of a private room in a nursing home is now over <span class=\"stat-box\">$300 per day</span>. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Five years of that care would consume over half a million dollars. Everything this cohort saved, everything this cohort built, can disappear into medical bills.</span></p><p>The three-legged stool of retirement—Social Security, pensions, personal savings—has lost a leg. This cohort's generation may be the last to receive meaningful pensions. Social Security faces funding shortfalls that politicians keep kicking down the road. Personal savings are supposed to carry the weight that institutions used to bear. This cohort're living the transition, and there's no going back to the system that worked for this cohort's parents.</p>"

Boomers worked hard, bought a house, built a career, saved for retirement. It worked. Effort led to reward. The system functioned. So when younger generations struggle with the same milestones, the natural assumption is they're not trying hard enough. But the water changed. The path this generation walked doesn't exist anymore—not because the path was easy, but because the economic landscape transformed after this generation crossed it.</p><p>This generation's generation talked about poverty, but often missed class. Boomers could be poor and become not-poor through effort—that was true in the postwar economy, at least for white Americans. The structural barriers that keep people poor today—healthcare costs, childcare costs, housing costs, the credentialing requirements for jobs that didn't used to need credentials—are different from the barriers this generation faced. Advice that worked in 1975 doesn't work in 2025. Not because the advice was wrong, but because the economy changed.</p><p>Climate change is the blind spot this generation's grandchildren will judge this generation for. This generation's generation knew. The science has been clear since the 1970s. Boomers watched the warnings get ignored, the deadlines pass, the glaciers melt. Maybe this generation drove a Prius. Maybe this generation recycled. But as a generation, this generation prioritized immediate comfort over long-term survival. The bill is coming due, and this generation won't be here to pay it.</p><p>The digital world is not optional, and refusing to learn it isn't principled resistance—it's self-imposed isolation. This generation's grandchildren don't answer phone calls. This generation's doctors communicate through patient portals. This generation's bank wants this generation to use an app. The skills this generation need to navigate modern life require technology, and many in this generation's generation have simply refused to acquire them. Some resistance is valid; some is stubbornness that costs this generation connection with people who communicate differently than this generation do.</p><p>And here's the sharpest truth: this generation's generation protested. Boomers marched against the war, demanded civil rights, questioned every institution this generation's parents built. Boomers was called naive, entitled, dangerous—exactly what this generation call younger generations now. The people who dismissed this generation was wrong. Is it possible this generation're wrong when this generation dismiss them? The kids questioning the economy, demanding climate action, rejecting the values this generation hold dear—they're doing exactly what this generation did at their age. The question is whether this generation can recognize this generation's younger self in their anger.</p><p>None of this is a condemnation. Every generation has blind spots. Every generation fails to see what comes next. But self-awareness is possible at any age, and the alternative—certainty that this generation understand a world that has changed beyond recognition—isn't wisdom. It's calcification.</p>"

This cohort's early twenties were chaos: assassinations, riots, the draft lottery, Woodstock, Kent State. This cohort either went to Vietnam, went to Canada, went to college on a deferment, or got lucky with a high lottery number. This cohort probably married young—the median was 23 for men, 21 for women. This cohort started careers when a job was still a job, when companies still hired for decades, when pensions still existed.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 30s (1977-1987):</strong> The '70s hangover extended into this cohort's thirties. Stagflation. Gas lines. Watergate's aftermath. The hostage crisis in Iran. This cohort were building families, buying houses, establishing careers while the economy lurched through oil shocks and recessions. Reagan arrived in 1981, and something fundamental shifted. This cohort were 33 when 'Morning in America' became the slogan—old enough to have benefited from the old rules, young enough to adapt to the new ones. MTV launched when this cohort was 34. AIDS emerged when this cohort was 34 too. The party was over in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 40s (1987-1997):</strong> Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. This cohort's children were teenagers, developing their own identities, rejecting theirs. This cohort's parents were aging, needing more. This cohort were sandwiched between generations who both needed things from this cohort. The Berlin Wall fell when this cohort was 42. The Soviet Union collapsed when this cohort was 44. The world this cohort'd spent this cohort's life navigating—the Cold War, the nuclear threat, the East-West divide—simply ended. The internet arrived, though this cohort probably encountered it first as a novelty, something the kids at work knew how to use.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 50s (1997-2007):</strong> The dotcom boom and bust happened in this cohort's fifties. This cohort watched younger colleagues get rich on paper, then watched the paper burn. At 54, this cohort saw the towers fall—the defining trauma of a new century, though this cohort'd already had this cohort's share of defining traumas. This cohort were probably thinking about retirement: When could this cohort afford to stop? What would this cohort do with the time? How much was enough? The answers depended on choices made decades earlier, luck, and economic forces beyond this cohort's control.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 60s (2007-2017):</strong> The 2008 crash hit when this cohort was 61. Maybe this cohort'd already retired. Maybe this cohort was planning to. Either way, this cohort watched this cohort's 401(k) lose 40% of its value in months. Some of this cohort's generation worked longer than planned. Some couldn't find work at all. Some sold houses they'd paid off, moved to smaller places, adjusted expectations. The 'golden years' narrative didn't match the reality of a world that had stopped making sense.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 70s and beyond (2017-present):</strong> This cohort've reached an age that used to mean slowing down, but this cohort's generation refuses to go quietly. COVID-19 hit this cohort hardest statistically—this cohort's age group bore the highest death rates. This cohort've navigated a pandemic, political polarization that echoes the '60s, and a digital world that wasn't built for this cohort. This cohort've seen more history than any generation alive.

Boomers came of age questioning everything. They fought in Korea without complaint; this generation fought in Vietnam or against it, loudly either way. They saved; this generation spent. They married once; this generation might have married twice or three times. They trust the news; this generation learned to be skeptical. They're quieter than this generation in every sense—smaller in number, smaller in volume, smaller in expectation.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They're this generation's children, or they could be. They grew up as latchkey kids while this generation worked late. They watched this generation divorce, watched this generation chase careers, watched this generation change the rules and then complain when they didn't follow them. They're cynical where this generation was idealistic—they saw what happened to idealism. They're sandwiched between this generation's massive generation and the equally massive Millennials, perpetually overlooked, and they seem fine with it. They don't trust institutions either, but they never expected to.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap between this generation's generation and theirs is the starkest in recorded history.</span> At age 35, Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age controlled 7%. Boomers had pensions; they have student loans. The avocado toast jokes aren't funny to them. The math doesn't work, and they know it, and they're tired of being told to work harder by a generation that had it objectively easier.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Boomers grew up with duck-and-cover drills for nuclear war; they grew up with active shooter drills for school shootings. Boomers saw the moon landing; they've never known a world without the internet. They communicate in memes this generation don't understand. They're more diverse, more tolerant, more anxious, and more broke than any generation before. They view this generation with a mixture of bewilderment and resentment, and honestly, the resentment isn't entirely unfair. Boomers inherited a better deal. Boomers know it. They know it.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">This generation's generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> This generation's life expectancy at birth was 68 years. If this generation've made it to 77, actuarial tables give this generation another decade, maybe more. Boomers're healthier in old age than this generation's parents were—better medicine, better nutrition, less smoking. But healthcare costs can still bankrupt this generation, and the systems this generation're relying on for support are under more strain than they've ever been. Boomers're living history's longest run. The view from here is complicated.</p>"
