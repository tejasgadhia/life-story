The youngest of your generation. Everyone born after you is Gen Z, which puts you in a strange position—you're technically a Millennial but often feel like you don't quite fit.</p><p>Your childhood was the late '90s and early 2000s—the Clinton boom, the dot-com bubble, Y2K anxiety. You were four when the world didn't end. Five when the dot-com bubble burst. You learned early that adults could be wrong about big things.</p><p>You were five during 9/11. Old enough to remember the day, maybe. Old enough to remember the fear. Too young to understand why the adults were crying, but old enough to know something terrible had happened. Your childhood was defined by the aftermath—the wars, the security theater, the sense that safety was no longer guaranteed.</p><p>Technology shaped your childhood differently than older Millennials. You probably had internet at home by kindergarten. You might have had a computer in your room by middle school. Digital wasn't new to you; it was normal. You're the bridge between Millennials who remember dial-up and Gen Z who never knew a world without Wi-Fi.</p><p>Your childhood ended with the 2008 financial crisis. You were twelve. Old enough to understand that your parents were stressed about money, that adults were losing jobs, that the economy was broken. You entered adolescence during the worst recession in eighty years.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Independence Day made aliens cool again and Tupac was killed. The Spice Girls debuted. Tickle Me Elmo caused riots. Pop culture in 1996 was weird and wonderful, though you'd have to discover most of it later.</p><p>Your childhood TV was Rugrats and SpongeBob, Lizzie McGuire and That's So Raven. Disney Channel was your babysitter. You grew up on Pixar—Toy Story came out the year before you were born, and every sequel landed during your childhood. Animation was your language.</p><p>Your teenage years were the late 2000s and early 2010s. You came of age during the transition from MySpace to Facebook, from iPods to iPhones, from MTV actually playing music to whatever MTV became. You watched the old world die and the new world struggle to be born.</p><p>You were thirteen when Twilight became a phenomenon. Fourteen when Avatar made 3D movies seem like the future. Fifteen when Instagram launched. Your adolescence was documented on platforms that kept changing—each one promising to last forever, each one eventually becoming irrelevant.</p><p>The MCU started when you were twelve. The iPhone when you were eleven. YouTube when you were nine. Every platform and franchise that dominates today launched during your childhood or adolescence. You grew up with them, which makes it hard to remember what came before.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Deep Blue beat Kasparov at chess, proving computers could outsmart humans at specific tasks. Technology in 1996 was Windows 95, dial-up modems, and CD-ROMs. The internet existed but wasn't essential yet. That would change fast.</p><p>You were three when Google launched. Four when Napster changed everything about music. Seven when the iPod arrived. Eight when Myspace launched. You grew up surfing each technological wave as it crested—young enough to adopt instantly, old enough to remember what came before.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_FACEBOOK}} when Facebook launched, {{AGE_AT_IPHONE}} when the iPhone arrived. You were in middle school or early high school, which means social media and smartphones arrived exactly when your social life was most complicated. For better and worse, these tools shaped how you learned to be a person.</p><p>You're the last generation to remember life before smartphones. Barely, but still. You had a childhood where boredom existed, where being unreachable was normal, where screens didn't follow you everywhere. That experience is increasingly rare, and it gives you perspective Gen Z doesn't have.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is native but not unconscious. You know how the algorithms work. You know the apps are designed to be addictive. You use them anyway because everyone does, but you're not naive about what they're doing to your attention span, your self-image, your understanding of reality.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were five during 9/11. You might remember the day—being sent home from school, the confusion, the fear on adult faces. You definitely remember the aftermath: the wars, the orange alerts, the TSA. Your childhood was saturated in post-9/11 anxiety.</p><p>You were eight when the Iraq War started. The news showed bombs falling on Baghdad while you were learning multiplication. War was background noise throughout your childhood—always happening somewhere, always on TV, never quite real but never quite fake either.</p><p>You were twelve during the 2008 financial crisis. Old enough to understand that something was wrong, that your parents were worried, that the economy had broken. You watched adults lose jobs, lose houses, lose faith. You entered adolescence knowing that stability wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>You were seventeen when Sandy Hook happened. The Parkland students were your generation—kids who'd grown up with active shooter drills, who finally said enough. You understood their anger because you'd lived the same reality.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_COVID}} during COVID. Your early career, maybe your first years of 'real' adulthood, were interrupted by a global pandemic. You adapted to remote everything, lost years of experiences you can't get back, emerged into a world that still hasn't figured out what normal means now.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around {{WORKFORCE_ENTRY_YEAR}}, into an economy still recovering from the 2008 crisis. Jobs existed, but career paths were uncertain. The gig economy was ascendant. 'Side hustle' became a necessity disguised as a lifestyle.</p><p>Your early career was defined by precarity. Unpaid internships. Contract work. Jobs that required degrees but didn't pay like they did. You learned to hustle because hustle was the only option. The stable careers your parents described sounded like fairy tales.</p><p>COVID hit when you were just establishing yourself. You'd barely figured out how offices worked before everyone went remote. You learned to build a career through screens, which is great preparation for whatever comes next but terrible for learning the informal skills that offices used to teach.</p><p>You're in the early-to-mid stages of your career now. Your earning potential is theoretically ahead of you, but so is uncertainty. Climate change, AI disruption, political instability—the future your career needs to navigate doesn't look like any future previous generations planned for.</p><p>You're watching older workers struggle to adapt to technology you find intuitive, while younger workers arrive expecting flexibility and boundaries you had to fight for. You're in the middle, translating between generations, hoping someone notices.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were twelve during the 2008 crisis—old enough to absorb the fear, young enough to have it shape your entire financial worldview. You watched adults lose everything. You learned that the economy could break, that security was an illusion, that the future your parents promised might not exist.</p><p>You graduated into a job market that was recovering but scarred. Student loans were a given—your generation normalized debt in ways that would horrify your grandparents. You expected to be paying off education for decades because everyone you knew was.</p><p>Housing feels impossible. You've watched prices climb while wages stagnated. First-time homeownership keeps getting pushed further into the future, if it's achievable at all. You've normalized renting long-term, which is less a choice than an adaptation to reality.</p><p>Your financial psychology is pessimistic but practical. You don't expect Social Security to exist when you need it. You don't expect pensions, don't expect stability, don't expect the system to work in your favor. You save what you can, invest cautiously, and hope for the best while preparing for worse.</p><p>You're skeptical of financial advice from older generations. When they tell you to stop buying lattes, you hear people who bought houses for $50,000 lecturing you about fiscal responsibility. The math has changed. The advice hasn't. You've learned to nod politely and ignore.</p>"

    "life_roadmap": {
      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> COVID ate the middle of this decade. You started your twenties in a recovering economy and hit a pandemic at twenty-four. You adapted—everyone adapted—but the years you lost don't come back. Your twenties were supposed to be for exploration, experimentation, mistakes. Some of that happened on Zoom.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> You're approaching this decade or just entering it. This is supposed to be when careers solidify, when families form, when life takes shape. The pressure is real, even if the path is unclear. You're doing this with less financial security than previous generations had, which means every decision feels higher-stakes.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Peak earning years, theoretically. Your kids, if you have them, will be growing up. Your parents will be aging. You'll be navigating climate change, technological disruption, whatever political crises emerge. The future is less predictable than it used to be, and you know it.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> You'll be planning for retirement while wondering if retirement is even a concept that will exist. Social Security's future is uncertain. Your 401(k) depends on markets that seem increasingly volatile. You'll need to work longer than your parents did, probably. That's just reality now.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_PLUS}}+):</strong> The world you'll retire into—if you retire—doesn't exist yet. Climate change will reshape geography. AI will reshape work. Politics will reshape everything. You'll adapt because you've been adapting your whole life. That's the skill you've been practicing since childhood.</p>"
