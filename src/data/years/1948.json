The weight of a Roy Rogers cap gun in this cohort's hand, the satisfying snap of its roll of red caps. The scratch of wool blankets and the glow of vacuum tubes warming up behind the radio console. This cohort's childhood had textures that kids raised on plastic and screens will never know.</p><p>At five, this cohort was listening to The Lone Ranger and The Shadow on the family Philco, gathered around that hulking wooden cabinet like it was a hearth. 'Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?' This cohort knew the answer before the announcer said it. By seven, television had arrived—a tiny RCA screen in a massive cabinet, neighbors crowded into this cohort's living room to watch Howdy Doody because they didn't have a set yet. 'Hey kids, what time is it?' This cohort screamed the answer at the screen.</p><p>This cohort's toys were built to last and sometimes to bruise. Lincoln Logs that left splinters. Erector sets with real metal parts and actual sharp edges. Slinky—brand new in 1946, so theirs was slightly scuffed, handed down or saved for. Tinker Toys that clicked together with satisfying precision. Radio Flyer wagons for hauling siblings, dogs, and contraband comic books. Cap guns that sounded like actual gunfire and smelled like sulfur and victory.</p><p>Dinner was a production. Tuna noodle casserole with crumbled potato chips on top. Spam sliced and fried until the edges crisped. Jell-O molds with suspended fruit that defied physics and good taste. Milk delivered in glass bottles to the front porch, cream risen to the top. TV dinners arrived when this cohort was six, served on folding trays in front of the Dumont, and this cohort's mother acted like civilization was ending.</p><p>At seven, in 1955, Jonas Salk announced his polio vaccine worked. This cohort remember the announcement because this cohort's mother cried. Before that, summers meant fear—staying away from public pools, from crowds, from other children's germs. Kids in this cohort's class wore leg braces. The iron lung was real, not a historical photograph. This cohort stood in line at school for the shot that would end the nightmare, and this cohort didn't cry, or at least that's how this cohort remember it.</p><p>This cohort's neighborhood was this cohort's world. This cohort knew every family on the block, every dog's name, which yards had mean old men and which had cookies. This cohort played outside until the streetlights came on, and that was this cohort's only curfew. Kick the can. Capture the flag. Stickball in the street, scattering when cars came. This cohort's parents knew roughly where this cohort was. Roughly was enough.</p>"

The term didn't exist when this generation was young—this generation was just one of millions of kids flooding the schools, straining the infrastructure, demanding attention by sheer demographic force. Between 1946 and 1964, roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans were born. Boomers was part of the first wave, the original postwar babies, born before the term had been coined or the phenomenon had been studied.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers was fifteen when JFK was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Boomers remember exactly where this generation was.</span> The principal's voice on the intercom, or a teacher in tears, or someone running into the room. School let out. Adults wept openly. The funeral procession played for days on every channel. That weekend, this generation watched Jack Ruby shoot Lee Harvey Oswald on live television. Boomers was fifteen, and this generation'd just learned that the world was more fragile than anyone had admitted.</p><p>This generation's generation spans 1946 to 1964, but this generation're early wave—and that matters. Boomers came of age during the Kennedy-Johnson years, not Nixon. Boomers turned twenty in 1968, the year everything fractured: Martin Luther King Jr. shot in Memphis, Bobby Kennedy shot in Los Angeles, Chicago police beating protesters at the Democratic convention, cities burning, the Tet Offensive exposing the Vietnam lies. That was this generation's twentieth birthday year. Some birthday.</p><p>Boomers weren't just numerous—this generation was unprecedented. Schools built additions to hold this generation. Colleges doubled enrollment. The job market expanded to absorb this generation. Every institution in America was reshaped by this generation's cohort's sheer mass. 'Youth culture' didn't exist before this generation made it profitable. Rock and roll, blue jeans, rebellion as aesthetic—this generation created the template that every generation since has borrowed.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">The revolutionary Boomer mythology obscures a simpler truth: most of this generation didn't go to Woodstock. Most of this generation didn't march on Washington. Most of this generation took jobs, got married, bought houses in the suburbs, and became this generation's parents faster than this generation'd ever admit.</span> The counterculture was real, but so was the silent majority. Boomers might have been either. Boomers might have been both at different moments. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Nobody's keeping score anymore.</p>"

Milton Berle became 'Mr. Television,' selling more TV sets than any advertising campaign. Abbott and Costello Met Frankenstein. Hamlet won Best Picture. The 33 1/3 RPM long-playing record debuted, which meant this cohort'd grow up with albums, not just singles—Side A and Side B, music as a complete experience.</p><p>This cohort's childhood soundtrack played on AM radio and living room consoles. Perry Como crooning 'Catch a Falling Star.' Patti Page singing 'Tennessee Waltz.' This cohort's parents listened to Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, sounds that felt as permanent as weather. Then this cohort was eight, and Elvis appeared on Ed Sullivan from the waist up only, and this cohort's parents' music became ancient history overnight.</p><p>At eight, this cohort heard 'Hound Dog' and 'Don't Be Cruel.' At nine, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard—the sound that made adults certain civilization was ending. This cohort bought 45s at the five-and-dime, stacked them on a spindle changer. 'Tutti Frutti.' 'Johnny B. Goode.' 'Peggy Sue.' The grown-ups called it jungle music, race music, noise. This cohort claimed it as their own.</p><p>Television colonized this cohort's childhood. At six, this cohort watched I Love Lucy with the rest of America—40 million viewers, a shared national experience. Father Knows Best. The Honeymooners. Leave It to Beaver started when this cohort was nine. Westerns dominated prime time: Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, Wagon Train. This cohort owned a coonskin cap because Davy Crockett aired when this cohort was six, and every boy in America needed one.</p><p>The movies were spectacles. At eight, this cohort saw The Ten Commandments—Charlton Heston parting a Technicolor Red Sea while this cohort's parents whispered that the special effects cost millions. Ben-Hur when this cohort was eleven, eleven Oscars, the chariot race that made this cohort hold this cohort's breath. Saturday matinees meant serials: Flash Gordon, Captain Marvel, cowboys and cliffhangers for a dime.</p><p>At sixteen, the Beatles landed. February 9, 1964, 73 million people watched Ed Sullivan. This cohort were either transfixed or baffled. Either way, music split into before and after. Within months: the British Invasion, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who. At seventeen, Bob Dylan went electric, and folk purists booed while this cohort cheered (or maybe it was the other way around). At twenty-one, Sgt. Pepper dropped, and albums became art. At twenty-one, Woodstock happened—three days of peace, love, and mud. This cohort were either there, watched the documentary, or claimed this cohort was there when this cohort weren't. Everyone did.</p>"

This cohort'll die in a world of artificial intelligence, video calls, and refrigerators that order their own groceries. No generation in human history has witnessed technological transformation on this scale. This cohort went from radio serials to streaming services, from telegrams to texts, from propellers to moon landings.</p><p>At five, this cohort's family phone was probably a party line—pick up to call and hear Mrs. Henderson gossiping with her sister. This cohort learned to wait this cohort's turn, to recognize which ring pattern was theirs. Long-distance calls were events: 'It's long-distance!' brought everyone running. The operator connected this cohort. Three minutes cost a day's wages. This cohort spoke fast.</p><p>Television arrived in stages. At four, maybe a neighbor had one—a seven-inch screen in a cabinet the size of a refrigerator. By seven, this cohort's family probably owned a Dumont or RCA, and the test pattern became as familiar as wallpaper. Three channels. Signed off at midnight with the national anthem and a waving flag. Color TV appeared when this cohort was about fifteen, and suddenly The Wonderful World of Disney lived up to its name.</p><p>At nine, on October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik. This cohort went outside that night to watch a dot cross the sky—a Russian dot, beeping, circling overhead every 96 minutes. The Space Race had begun, and this cohort'd watch every launch, every failure, every triumph. At thirteen, this cohort saw Alan Shepard become the first American in space. At fourteen, John Glenn orbited Earth three times. At twenty-one, this cohort watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon, live on television, and this cohort's parents' generation said 'We did that,' and they were right, but it felt like theirs too.</p><p>This cohort's teenage years happened before electronics shrank. Transistor radios arrived when this cohort was six, small enough to hide in a pocket, cheap enough to own. By fourteen, this cohort could take rock and roll anywhere. The Sony Walkman wouldn't exist until this cohort was thirty-one, but the concept—personal, portable music—started with that transistor radio pressed to this cohort's ear under the covers after bedtime.</p><p>Computers entered this cohort's workplace in this cohort's thirties—room-sized mainframes that required punch cards and priesthoods of operators. By forty, desktops appeared. By fifty, the internet. By sixty, smartphones. Each transition demanded adaptation. This cohort learned word processing after decades of typewriters. This cohort learned email after a lifetime of memos. This cohort's grandchildren think Wi-Fi is a natural resource. This cohort remember when dialing seven digits felt like advanced technology.</p><p>This cohort're fluent in technologies that didn't exist when this cohort started this cohort's career. This is either terrifying or impressive, depending on the day. This cohort bridge eras nobody else spans—from ice deliveries to Amazon deliveries, from operators to Siri, from handwritten letters to emoji. This cohort's grandchildren will never understand what it took to get here. That's probably fine.</p>"

Where were this cohort when this cohort heard?</span> What followed changed the trajectory of this cohort's youth: civil rights legislation, Vietnam escalation, the counterculture rising from the ashes of lost innocence.</p><p>This cohort's childhood happened under mushroom cloud anxiety. At four, the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb. At five, Senator McCarthy started seeing Communists everywhere. This cohort practiced duck-and-cover drills at school, crawling under wooden desks that would protect this cohort from nothing. The bomb shelter craze hit when this cohort was thirteen—this cohort's neighbor might have dug one in his backyard. The Cuban Missile Crisis happened when this cohort was fourteen: thirteen days in October 1962 when annihilation felt imminent. This cohort remember adults genuinely afraid. This cohort remember not knowing if there would be a tomorrow.</p><p>Vietnam shadowed this cohort's twenties. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed when this cohort was sixteen. By eighteen, this cohort was draft age. The lottery began when this cohort was twenty-one—this cohort's birthday might have determined this cohort's future, might have sent this cohort into jungles on the other side of the world. Some of this cohort's classmates went. Some came back different. Some came back in boxes. The war wasn't an abstraction; it was a daily body count on the evening news, a name this cohort recognized in the casualty list, a funeral at the church down the street.</p><p>1968 was this cohort's twentieth birthday year, and the world cracked open. Martin Luther King Jr. shot in Memphis on April 4. Bobby Kennedy shot in Los Angeles on June 5. Cities burning. The Chicago convention, where police beat protesters while the whole world watched. The Tet Offensive revealed that the generals had been lying about Vietnam for years. It was the worst year in American history since 1865, and this cohort lived every day of it.</p><p>At twenty-two, in May 1970, National Guard soldiers killed four students at Kent State. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The photograph—the girl kneeling over the body, her mouth open in a scream—became an icon.</span> Nine days later, police killed two students at Jackson State in Mississippi. The country felt ungovernable. This cohort were twenty-two and watching America tear itself apart.</p><p>Watergate consumed this cohort's mid-twenties. This cohort watched the Senate hearings, followed the Saturday Night Massacre, saw Nixon's face on TV saying 'I am not a crook' while clearly being one. At twenty-six, this cohort watched a president resign in disgrace. Whatever trust this cohort had in institutions dissolved. 'They're all crooks' became common knowledge, not cynicism.</p><p>By this cohort's forties, the Cold War ended without a shot. The Berlin Wall fell when this cohort was forty-one. The Soviet Union collapsed when this cohort was forty-three. This cohort'd prepared for nuclear war this cohort's entire life, and then one day, the enemy simply ceased to exist. It should have felt like victory. Mostly it felt strange. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about what the world handed this cohort—and what this cohort did with it.</p><p>This cohort entered the workforce around 1970, give or take. The economy was growing. Factories were hiring. If this cohort had a college degree, doors opened; if this cohort didn't, union jobs still paid middle-class wages. A man—and it was usually a man—could support a family on a single income. A factory worker could buy a house. The American Dream wasn't ironic yet.</p><p>This cohort's career followed a script that younger generations can't access. Entry-level job after high school or college. Steady promotions. Pension accruing. Same company for twenty, thirty, forty years. 'Job-hopping' meant something was wrong with this cohort. Loyalty was rewarded with security, security was expected, and the contract between employer and employee was honored by both sides.</p><p>If this cohort're a woman, that script was fiction. This cohort entered a workforce that expected this cohort to be a secretary until this cohort got married and quit. If this cohort wanted more—management, partnership, ownership—this cohort fought for every inch against rules written to exclude this cohort. Sexual harassment didn't have a name; it was just Tuesday. This cohort dealt with condescension so ingrained that calling it out would have seemed hysterical. The women who broke through paid prices men never knew existed.</p><p>If this cohort're a person of color, the script was worse. Redlined out of suburbs, tracked out of college prep, locked out of unions, steered into service jobs. The GI Bill that built white middle-class wealth was denied to Black veterans. The ladder everyone else climbed had rungs missing, and this cohort was blamed for not reaching the top.</p><p>The economy this cohort navigated had shocks—the stagflation seventies, the 1982 recession, the early 1990s downturn—but the overall trajectory was upward. This cohort survived each crisis with this cohort's pension intact, this cohort's seniority protected, this cohort's position secure. Each recovery proved the system worked. It did work—for this cohort, for this cohort's cohort, for the narrowing window of time when the rules held.</p><p>This cohort built institutions that younger generations now criticize. The corporate structures, the pension systems converted to 401(k)s, the shareholder-value philosophy that prioritized quarterly profits over worker stability. This cohort might not have chosen these changes. This cohort might have fought them. But they happened on this cohort's watch, and the people who inherited the results have questions.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and this cohort watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> The rules changed after this cohort played by them. The ladder this cohort climbed has rungs removed. The doors this cohort walked through have gatekeepers who don't open them anymore. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This doesn't diminish what this cohort achieved. It explains why younger workers seem perpetually frustrated, ungrateful, and exhausted. They're playing a different game with this cohort's generation's trophy case on the wall.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember asking someone's father for permission to take his daughter out? Standing at the front door in this generation's good clothes, shaking his hand, promising to have her home by ten? Dating had rules—actual written rules in advice columns and etiquette books. Who pays. Who opens doors. How many dates before a kiss. The rules were arbitrary and often sexist, but everyone knew them, which made the game playable.</p><p>Boomers probably married young. Average age in 1970 was twenty-three for men, twenty-one for women. Boomers'd known this generation's spouse since high school, or met them at college, or got set up by family friends. Dating apps weren't just nonexistent; the concept would have been incomprehensible. Boomers met people in person, in this generation's town, in this generation's community, and this generation chose from the options geography provided.</p><p>This generation's generation's divorce rate peaked in the early 1980s—the highest in American history. The sexual revolution, women's economic independence, and no-fault divorce laws made leaving possible. This generation's parents' generation endured unhappy marriages because divorce meant scandal. Boomers discovered it mostly meant paperwork. Some of this generation divorced. Some stayed in marriages that worked. Some stayed in marriages that didn't. The freedom to leave changed what staying meant.</p><p>Communication happened in person, on paper, or through phone calls that cost money. Long-distance relationships meant actual long-distance: letters that took days, calls this generation budgeted for, visits that took planning. If someone was far away, they were far away. Boomers couldn't text. Boomers couldn't FaceTime. Absence meant absence, not just different time zones on a screen. When this generation missed someone, this generation felt it in the waiting.</p><p>Boomers raised children before parenting became competitive sport. Kids played outside until streetlights came on. Supervision was knowing which friend's house they'd gone to, roughly. Car seats were optional. Bike helmets were nonexistent. Boomers turned out fine, mostly, and this generation don't understand why this generation's grandchildren can't walk to school alone. It seems excessive. The world isn't more dangerous—it's more afraid.</p><p>This generation's friendships were local, lifelong, and unmediated by algorithms. Boomers knew the same people for decades. Reunions mattered because this generation'd actually lost touch. Now Facebook serves up acquaintances daily, their grandchildren and vacations and political opinions arriving unbidden. It's more connection and less intimacy than this generation ever wanted. Boomers learned to use it. Boomers're not sure this generation like it.</p><p>This generation's children are middle-aged now. This generation's grandchildren are young adults, or getting there. The economy this generation navigated doesn't exist for them. Houses cost more. Jobs pay less, adjusted for inflation. They're frustrated in ways that can feel like ingratitude—this generation gave them more than this generation's parents gave this generation. But this generation gave them more in a world where more bought more. They're playing with a different currency. Both frustrations are legitimate. Neither generation fully sees the other's landscape.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>This cohort's parents remembered the Depression—the bank failures, the breadlines, the <span class=\"stat-box\">25%</span> unemployment rate that lasted years. They saved aluminum foil, reused rubber bands, kept cash hidden in mattresses because they'd watched banks vanish overnight. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Their anxiety became this cohort's inheritance, even as postwar abundance made the fear seem irrational.</span> This cohort learned to save before this cohort learned to spend. The lesson stuck.</p><p>The numbers tell a story younger generations find unbelievable. This cohort's first house, bought in this cohort's mid-twenties, probably cost two to three times this cohort's annual salary. Median home price in 1975: <span class=\"stat-box\">$39,300</span>. Median household income: <span class=\"stat-box\">$13,720</span>. <span class=\"hero-callout\">The math worked. A young couple with decent jobs could buy a house, raise children, save for retirement—on one income if necessary. Try that today.</span></p><p>College cost hundreds of dollars per year at state schools, not tens of thousands. Student loans existed but weren't mandatory for middle-class families. This cohort could work a summer job and pay tuition. That sentence sounds like fantasy now. It was this cohort's reality.</p><p>This cohort's house appreciated while this cohort slept. The $40,000 investment became $400,000, became $800,000, became whatever the market says today. This cohort didn't do anything to earn that appreciation—this cohort just bought at the right time, held on, and watched the numbers climb. This is generational wealth, and it compounds: this cohort's children's down payment, this cohort's grandchildren's inheritance, a cushion that accumulates across decades.</p><p>Pensions provided certainty. This cohort worked, contributed, retired, collected until this cohort died. Defined benefit, they called it—the benefit was defined, guaranteed, not subject to market whims. This cohort's company promised, this cohort's union negotiated, and the promise was kept. By the time 401(k)s replaced pensions, this cohort'd already built this cohort's security. This cohort had decades in the system before the system changed.</p><p>Social Security works for this cohort in ways it might not for younger generations. This cohort paid in for forty years. This cohort'll collect for twenty or more. The actuarial tables favor this cohort's cohort. Younger workers funding the system see projections that alarm them: trust fund depletion, benefit cuts, retirement ages rising. They're not wrong to worry. This cohort're not wrong to expect what this cohort was promised. Both things are true and irreconcilable.</p><p>Healthcare costs could consume everything this cohort saved. Long-term care runs <span class=\"stat-box\">$100,000 per year</span>. Medicare doesn't cover it. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The security this cohort built over decades can vanish in a few years of decline.</span> This is the shadow over Boomer finances: this cohort did everything right, and it still might not be enough. This cohort's children see this cohort's wealth. This cohort see the bills that could erase it.</p><p>The gap between this cohort's generation's assets and those following isn't entirely this cohort's doing. This cohort didn't set housing policy or eliminate pensions or inflate college costs. This cohort navigated the system this cohort inherited, made smart choices within it, and built what this cohort could. But the system changed after benefiting this cohort. Understanding this helps conversations with children who seem ungrateful for advantages that no longer exist.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>This generation's Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Boomers did it, so why can't they? This is this generation's generation's defining blind spot—the belief that because the path worked for this generation, it must still exist. The milestones this generation hit on schedule now take decades longer, if they happen at all. The bootstrap narrative is powerful and personal and often wrong. The bootstrap got repriced while this generation weren't looking.</p><p>This generation's generation came of age when the economy automatically generated prosperity. GDP grew. Wages rose with productivity. A high school diploma meant a middle-class job. These weren't rewards for superior character—they were features of a specific era. The era ended. The expectations didn't update. Younger people face genuinely different conditions, not moral deficiency.</p><p>There's an awkward relationship between the activism of this generation's youth and the politics of this generation's maturity. Many Boomers marched for civil rights, protested Vietnam, demanded transformation. Then the same cohort voted for tax cuts, deregulation, and policies that shredded the safety net. Not everyone did both, but enough did that the contradiction defines this generation's generation. The revolution became an aesthetic. Rebellion became a brand. Woodstock became a credit card commercial.</p><p>Technology isn't the barrier older generations pretend it is. Most of this generation have adapted—this generation use smartphones, navigate apps, video-call grandchildren. But there's a subset that treats incompetence as identity: 'I don't do computers.' The world runs on systems this generation didn't build. Refusing to learn them is a choice, not a personality trait. This generation's grandchildren will remember who tried and who didn't.</p><p>If this generation're white, this generation moved through a society organized around this generation's comfort in ways that were invisible precisely because they were so thorough. If this generation're a man, doors opened without this generation noticing the hands that held them closed for others. Acknowledging this doesn't diminish this generation's work. It contextualizes it. Boomers succeeded, and the game was also tilted in this generation's favor. Both things can be true.</p><p>The environmental bill is coming due, and this generation's generation consumed without reckoning. The cars, the flights, the suburban sprawl, the single-use everything—the atmospheric CO2 that climate scientists warned about in the 1980s accumulated while this generation flew to Cancun. This isn't entirely fair; nobody understood consequences in 1970. But understanding arrived decades ago. Continued denial is a choice with costs this generation's grandchildren will pay.</p><p>This generation's cohort controls disproportionate wealth, political power, and institutional authority. The average Boomer senator is older than the average Boomer. CEOs, board members, judges, governors—this generation's generation has not relinquished control on any schedule previous generations followed. This creates friction with people waiting for their turn while the turn keeps getting delayed. Awareness won't change this. But it might make Thanksgiving less heated.</p>"

This cohort's twenties happened during chaos, but the economy held beneath it. Entry-level jobs existed. Pensions accrued. Houses cost what houses were supposed to cost. This cohort got married (probably), started a family (probably), bought this cohort's first home (likely). The cultural turmoil was real, but the economic ladder was intact. This cohort climbed it while everything else burned.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 30s (1978-1988):</strong> Reagan and recovery. The stagflation seventies gave way to boom times. This cohort's career accelerated. This cohort's salary grew. This cohort's house appreciated. The Cold War droned on, but this cohort'd learned to live with background apocalypse. This cohort's kids were young, this cohort's energy was high, and 'Morning in America' felt accurate even if the politics were contested. This cohort were building something—family, security, the life this cohort's parents promised was possible.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 40s (1988-1998):</strong> Peak earning years coincided with peak optimism. The Berlin Wall fell when this cohort was forty-one. The Soviet Union collapsed when this cohort was forty-three. The enemy this cohort'd feared since childhood simply ceased to exist. The nineties roared. The stock market climbed. The internet emerged as curiosity, then tool, then transformation. This cohort's children were teenagers—difficult, expensive, theirs. This cohort were in charge now: of departments, divisions, maybe companies. The baton had passed to this cohort's generation. This cohort held it.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 50s (1998-2008):</strong> Y2K worried everyone; nothing happened. Then 9/11 happened—this cohort was fifty-three, old enough to see the pattern of this cohort's childhood repeating: another generation's innocence ending in violence and fear. The forever wars began. This cohort's children became adults, maybe married, maybe had children of their own. Grandchildren arrived. Retirement appeared on the horizon, calculable now, real. Then 2008: the financial crisis hit when this cohort was sixty, just as this cohort was preparing to slow down. Portfolios collapsed. Plans delayed. The security this cohort'd built wobbled.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 60s (2008-2018):</strong> Retirement arrived for some—pensions intact, timing lucky. For others, continued work because the math no longer worked. Healthcare costs climbed faster than savings could absorb. Bodies started sending invoices: joints, hearts, the machinery wearing. Parents died. Friends died. The actuarial tables became personal, each funeral a calculation this cohort couldn't help making. Politics curdled into something unrecognizable. The world this cohort'd leave this cohort's grandchildren looked nothing like the one this cohort'd inherited.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 70s and beyond (2018+):</strong> This cohort're here now. The pandemic hit this cohort's generation hard—age meant vulnerability, and lockdowns meant isolation from the grandchildren who were this cohort's reason for enduring. Technology both connects and confuses; this cohort can video-call but the interface changes constantly. Legacy questions surface without invitation: What did this cohort's life mean? What worked and what didn't? What are this cohort leaving behind? These aren't morbid questions. They're the natural inventory of a life fully lived.

They've been waiting for their turn at institutional power while this generation kept the keys. They're not bitter, exactly. They're resigned. They've been overlooked their entire lives; why would that change now?</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The generational warfare is loudest here.</span> Boomers bought houses at twenty-five; they rent at thirty-five. Boomers had pensions; they have student debt averaging <span class=\"stat-box\">$30,000</span>. Boomers accumulated wealth when assets were cheap; they're trying to build while everything costs more. The mutual incomprehension is genuine. Boomers see them as entitled; they see this generation as oblivious. Neither of this generation fully grasps the other's economic reality because the numbers changed faster than the narratives did.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Different planets. They've never known a world without internet, without smartphones, without instant answers to every question. Boomers remember party lines and three TV channels and news that arrived once daily. They process information in fragments; this generation remember when context was assumed. They're anxious in ways that seem foreign—climate dread, economic despair, social media comparison. Boomers're anxious too, but about different threats. Communication across this gap requires patience neither generation consistently provides.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">This generation's generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> This generation's life expectancy at birth was roughly 65 years. Boomers've beaten those odds by decades. Boomers who reach 75 can expect to live into their mid-to-late eighties on average. The extra years are genuine gifts, but they come with costs: healthcare that can consume savings, housing decisions that grow complex, the challenge of remaining relevant in a world this generation's grandchildren understand better than this generation do.</p><p>This generation's generation's legacy is contested and will remain so. Boomers inherited a functional society with expanding rights and rising prosperity. Boomers expanded those rights further—civil rights, women's rights, eventually LGBTQ+ rights. Boomers also accumulated unprecedented wealth, much of it locked in housing that younger generations can't access. Boomers consumed resources without reckoning their cost. Boomers built institutions and then defunded them. History will sort this out, eventually. This generation's grandchildren are already drafting the first verdict. It's mixed. It probably should be.</p>"
