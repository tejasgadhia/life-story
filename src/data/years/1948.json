      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1948-1960</h2><p>The smell of Ovaltine and the crackle of radio static. The weight of a Roy Rogers cap gun in your hand, the satisfying snap of its roll of red caps. The scratch of wool blankets and the glow of vacuum tubes warming up behind the radio console. Your childhood had textures that kids raised on plastic and screens will never know.</p><p>At five, you were listening to The Lone Ranger and The Shadow on the family Philco, gathered around that hulking wooden cabinet like it was a hearth. 'Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?' You knew the answer before the announcer said it. By seven, television had arrived—a tiny RCA screen in a massive cabinet, neighbors crowded into your living room to watch Howdy Doody because they didn't have a set yet. 'Hey kids, what time is it?' You screamed the answer at the screen.</p><p>Your toys were built to last and sometimes to bruise. Lincoln Logs that left splinters. Erector sets with real metal parts and actual sharp edges. Slinky—brand new in 1946, so yours was slightly scuffed, handed down or saved for. Tinker Toys that clicked together with satisfying precision. Radio Flyer wagons for hauling siblings, dogs, and contraband comic books. Cap guns that sounded like actual gunfire and smelled like sulfur and victory.</p><p>Dinner was a production. Tuna noodle casserole with crumbled potato chips on top. Spam sliced and fried until the edges crisped. Jell-O molds with suspended fruit that defied physics and good taste. Milk delivered in glass bottles to the front porch, cream risen to the top. TV dinners arrived when you were six, served on folding trays in front of the Dumont, and your mother acted like civilization was ending.</p><p>At seven, in 1955, Jonas Salk announced his polio vaccine worked. You remember the announcement because your mother cried. Before that, summers meant fear—staying away from public pools, from crowds, from other children's germs. Kids in your class wore leg braces. The iron lung was real, not a historical photograph. You stood in line at school for the shot that would end the nightmare, and you didn't cry, or at least that's how you remember it.</p><p>Your neighborhood was your world. You knew every family on the block, every dog's name, which yards had mean old men and which had cookies. You played outside until the streetlights came on, and that was your only curfew. Kick the can. Capture the flag. Stickball in the street, scattering when cars came. Your parents knew roughly where you were. Roughly was enough.</p>"

The term didn't exist when you were young—you were just one of millions of kids flooding the schools, straining the infrastructure, demanding attention by sheer demographic force. Between 1946 and 1964, roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans were born. You were part of the first wave, the original postwar babies, born before the term had been coined or the phenomenon had been studied.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were fifteen when JFK was assassinated on November 22, 1963. You remember exactly where you were.</span> The principal's voice on the intercom, or a teacher in tears, or someone running into the room. School let out. Adults wept openly. The funeral procession played for days on every channel. That weekend, you watched Jack Ruby shoot Lee Harvey Oswald on live television. You were fifteen, and you'd just learned that the world was more fragile than anyone had admitted.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964, but you're early wave—and that matters. You came of age during the Kennedy-Johnson years, not Nixon. You turned twenty in 1968, the year everything fractured: Martin Luther King Jr. shot in Memphis, Bobby Kennedy shot in Los Angeles, Chicago police beating protesters at the Democratic convention, cities burning, the Tet Offensive exposing the Vietnam lies. That was your twentieth birthday year. Some birthday.</p><p>You weren't just numerous—you were unprecedented. Schools built additions to hold you. Colleges doubled enrollment. The job market expanded to absorb you. Every institution in America was reshaped by your cohort's sheer mass. 'Youth culture' didn't exist before you made it profitable. Rock and roll, blue jeans, rebellion as aesthetic—you created the template that every generation since has borrowed.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">The revolutionary Boomer mythology obscures a simpler truth: most of you didn't go to Woodstock. Most of you didn't march on Washington. Most of you took jobs, got married, bought houses in the suburbs, and became your parents faster than you'd ever admit.</span> The counterculture was real, but so was the silent majority. You might have been either. You might have been both at different moments. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Nobody's keeping score anymore.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, Ed Sullivan launched the variety show that would introduce America to Elvis and the Beatles. Milton Berle became 'Mr. Television,' selling more TV sets than any advertising campaign. Abbott and Costello Met Frankenstein. Hamlet won Best Picture. The 33 1/3 RPM long-playing record debuted, which meant you'd grow up with albums, not just singles—Side A and Side B, music as a complete experience.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack played on AM radio and living room consoles. Perry Como crooning 'Catch a Falling Star.' Patti Page singing 'Tennessee Waltz.' Your parents listened to Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, sounds that felt as permanent as weather. Then you were eight, and Elvis appeared on Ed Sullivan from the waist up only, and your parents' music became ancient history overnight.</p><p>At eight, you heard 'Hound Dog' and 'Don't Be Cruel.' At nine, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard—the sound that made adults certain civilization was ending. You bought 45s at the five-and-dime, stacked them on a spindle changer. 'Tutti Frutti.' 'Johnny B. Goode.' 'Peggy Sue.' The grown-ups called it jungle music, race music, noise. You called it yours.</p><p>Television colonized your childhood. At six, you watched I Love Lucy with the rest of America—40 million viewers, a shared national experience. Father Knows Best. The Honeymooners. Leave It to Beaver started when you were nine. Westerns dominated prime time: Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, Wagon Train. You owned a coonskin cap because Davy Crockett aired when you were six, and every boy in America needed one.</p><p>The movies were spectacles. At eight, you saw The Ten Commandments—Charlton Heston parting a Technicolor Red Sea while your parents whispered that the special effects cost millions. Ben-Hur when you were eleven, eleven Oscars, the chariot race that made you hold your breath. Saturday matinees meant serials: Flash Gordon, Captain Marvel, cowboys and cliffhangers for a dime.</p><p>At sixteen, the Beatles landed. February 9, 1964, 73 million people watched Ed Sullivan. You were either transfixed or baffled. Either way, music split into before and after. Within months: the British Invasion, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who. At seventeen, Bob Dylan went electric, and folk purists booed while you cheered (or maybe it was the other way around). At twenty-one, Sgt. Pepper dropped, and albums became art. At twenty-one, Woodstock happened—three days of peace, love, and mud. You were either there, watched the documentary, or claimed you were there when you weren't. Everyone did.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born into vacuum tubes, party lines, and iceboxes. You'll die in a world of artificial intelligence, video calls, and refrigerators that order their own groceries. No generation in human history has witnessed technological transformation on this scale. You went from radio serials to streaming services, from telegrams to texts, from propellers to moon landings.</p><p>At five, your family phone was probably a party line—pick up to call and hear Mrs. Henderson gossiping with her sister. You learned to wait your turn, to recognize which ring pattern was yours. Long-distance calls were events: 'It's long-distance!' brought everyone running. The operator connected you. Three minutes cost a day's wages. You spoke fast.</p><p>Television arrived in stages. At four, maybe a neighbor had one—a seven-inch screen in a cabinet the size of a refrigerator. By seven, your family probably owned a Dumont or RCA, and the test pattern became as familiar as wallpaper. Three channels. Signed off at midnight with the national anthem and a waving flag. Color TV appeared when you were about fifteen, and suddenly The Wonderful World of Disney lived up to its name.</p><p>At nine, on October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik. You went outside that night to watch a dot cross the sky—a Russian dot, beeping, circling overhead every 96 minutes. The Space Race had begun, and you'd watch every launch, every failure, every triumph. At thirteen, you saw Alan Shepard become the first American in space. At fourteen, John Glenn orbited Earth three times. At twenty-one, you watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon, live on television, and your parents' generation said 'We did that,' and they were right, but it felt like yours too.</p><p>Your teenage years happened before electronics shrank. Transistor radios arrived when you were six, small enough to hide in a pocket, cheap enough to own. By fourteen, you could take rock and roll anywhere. The Sony Walkman wouldn't exist until you were thirty-one, but the concept—personal, portable music—started with that transistor radio pressed to your ear under the covers after bedtime.</p><p>Computers entered your workplace in your thirties—room-sized mainframes that required punch cards and priesthoods of operators. By forty, desktops appeared. By fifty, the internet. By sixty, smartphones. Each transition demanded adaptation. You learned word processing after decades of typewriters. You learned email after a lifetime of memos. Your grandchildren think Wi-Fi is a natural resource. You remember when dialing seven digits felt like advanced technology.</p><p>You're fluent in technologies that didn't exist when you started your career. This is either terrifying or impressive, depending on the day. You bridge eras nobody else spans—from ice deliveries to Amazon deliveries, from operators to Siri, from handwritten letters to emoji. Your grandchildren will never understand what it took to get here. That's probably fine.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">November 22, 1963—the day your generation's defining moment happened. Where were you when you heard?</span> What followed changed the trajectory of your youth: civil rights legislation, Vietnam escalation, the counterculture rising from the ashes of lost innocence.</p><p>Your childhood happened under mushroom cloud anxiety. At four, the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb. At five, Senator McCarthy started seeing Communists everywhere. You practiced duck-and-cover drills at school, crawling under wooden desks that would protect you from nothing. The bomb shelter craze hit when you were thirteen—your neighbor might have dug one in his backyard. The Cuban Missile Crisis happened when you were fourteen: thirteen days in October 1962 when annihilation felt imminent. You remember adults genuinely afraid. You remember not knowing if there would be a tomorrow.</p><p>Vietnam shadowed your twenties. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed when you were sixteen. By eighteen, you were draft age. The lottery began when you were twenty-one—your birthday might have determined your future, might have sent you into jungles on the other side of the world. Some of your classmates went. Some came back different. Some came back in boxes. The war wasn't an abstraction; it was a daily body count on the evening news, a name you recognized in the casualty list, a funeral at the church down the street.</p><p>1968 was your twentieth birthday year, and the world cracked open. Martin Luther King Jr. shot in Memphis on April 4. Bobby Kennedy shot in Los Angeles on June 5. Cities burning. The Chicago convention, where police beat protesters while the whole world watched. The Tet Offensive revealed that the generals had been lying about Vietnam for years. It was the worst year in American history since 1865, and you lived every day of it.</p><p>At twenty-two, in May 1970, National Guard soldiers killed four students at Kent State. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The photograph—the girl kneeling over the body, her mouth open in a scream—became an icon.</span> Nine days later, police killed two students at Jackson State in Mississippi. The country felt ungovernable. You were twenty-two and watching America tear itself apart.</p><p>Watergate consumed your mid-twenties. You watched the Senate hearings, followed the Saturday Night Massacre, saw Nixon's face on TV saying 'I am not a crook' while clearly being one. At twenty-six, you watched a president resign in disgrace. Whatever trust you had in institutions dissolved. 'They're all crooks' became common knowledge, not cynicism.</p><p>By your forties, the Cold War ended without a shot. The Berlin Wall fell when you were forty-one. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were forty-three. You'd prepared for nuclear war your entire life, and then one day, the enemy simply ceased to exist. It should have felt like victory. Mostly it felt strange. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about what the world handed you—and what you did with it.</p><p>You entered the workforce around 1970, give or take. The economy was growing. Factories were hiring. If you had a college degree, doors opened; if you didn't, union jobs still paid middle-class wages. A man—and it was usually a man—could support a family on a single income. A factory worker could buy a house. The American Dream wasn't ironic yet.</p><p>Your career followed a script that younger generations can't access. Entry-level job after high school or college. Steady promotions. Pension accruing. Same company for twenty, thirty, forty years. 'Job-hopping' meant something was wrong with you. Loyalty was rewarded with security, security was expected, and the contract between employer and employee was honored by both sides.</p><p>If you're a woman, that script was fiction. You entered a workforce that expected you to be a secretary until you got married and quit. If you wanted more—management, partnership, ownership—you fought for every inch against rules written to exclude you. Sexual harassment didn't have a name; it was just Tuesday. You dealt with condescension so ingrained that calling it out would have seemed hysterical. The women who broke through paid prices men never knew existed.</p><p>If you're a person of color, the script was worse. Redlined out of suburbs, tracked out of college prep, locked out of unions, steered into service jobs. The GI Bill that built white middle-class wealth was denied to Black veterans. The ladder everyone else climbed had rungs missing, and you were blamed for not reaching the top.</p><p>The economy you navigated had shocks—the stagflation seventies, the 1982 recession, the early 1990s downturn—but the overall trajectory was upward. You survived each crisis with your pension intact, your seniority protected, your position secure. Each recovery proved the system worked. It did work—for you, for your cohort, for the narrowing window of time when the rules held.</p><p>You built institutions that younger generations now criticize. The corporate structures, the pension systems converted to 401(k)s, the shareholder-value philosophy that prioritized quarterly profits over worker stability. You might not have chosen these changes. You might have fought them. But they happened on your watch, and the people who inherited the results have questions.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and you watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> The rules changed after you played by them. The ladder you climbed has rungs removed. The doors you walked through have gatekeepers who don't open them anymore. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This doesn't diminish what you achieved. It explains why younger workers seem perpetually frustrated, ungrateful, and exhausted. They're playing a different game with your generation's trophy case on the wall.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember asking someone's father for permission to take his daughter out? Standing at the front door in your good clothes, shaking his hand, promising to have her home by ten? Dating had rules—actual written rules in advice columns and etiquette books. Who pays. Who opens doors. How many dates before a kiss. The rules were arbitrary and often sexist, but everyone knew them, which made the game playable.</p><p>You probably married young. Average age in 1970 was twenty-three for men, twenty-one for women. You'd known your spouse since high school, or met them at college, or got set up by family friends. Dating apps weren't just nonexistent; the concept would have been incomprehensible. You met people in person, in your town, in your community, and you chose from the options geography provided.</p><p>Your generation's divorce rate peaked in the early 1980s—the highest in American history. The sexual revolution, women's economic independence, and no-fault divorce laws made leaving possible. Your parents' generation endured unhappy marriages because divorce meant scandal. You discovered it mostly meant paperwork. Some of you divorced. Some stayed in marriages that worked. Some stayed in marriages that didn't. The freedom to leave changed what staying meant.</p><p>Communication happened in person, on paper, or through phone calls that cost money. Long-distance relationships meant actual long-distance: letters that took days, calls you budgeted for, visits that took planning. If someone was far away, they were far away. You couldn't text. You couldn't FaceTime. Absence meant absence, not just different time zones on a screen. When you missed someone, you felt it in the waiting.</p><p>You raised children before parenting became competitive sport. Kids played outside until streetlights came on. Supervision was knowing which friend's house they'd gone to, roughly. Car seats were optional. Bike helmets were nonexistent. You turned out fine, mostly, and you don't understand why your grandchildren can't walk to school alone. It seems excessive. The world isn't more dangerous—it's more afraid.</p><p>Your friendships were local, lifelong, and unmediated by algorithms. You knew the same people for decades. Reunions mattered because you'd actually lost touch. Now Facebook serves up acquaintances daily, their grandchildren and vacations and political opinions arriving unbidden. It's more connection and less intimacy than you ever wanted. You learned to use it. You're not sure you like it.</p><p>Your children are middle-aged now. Your grandchildren are young adults, or getting there. The economy you navigated doesn't exist for them. Houses cost more. Jobs pay less, adjusted for inflation. They're frustrated in ways that can feel like ingratitude—you gave them more than your parents gave you. But you gave them more in a world where more bought more. They're playing with a different currency. Both frustrations are legitimate. Neither generation fully sees the other's landscape.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents remembered the Depression—the bank failures, the breadlines, the <span class=\"stat-box\">25%</span> unemployment rate that lasted years. They saved aluminum foil, reused rubber bands, kept cash hidden in mattresses because they'd watched banks vanish overnight. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Their anxiety became your inheritance, even as postwar abundance made the fear seem irrational.</span> You learned to save before you learned to spend. The lesson stuck.</p><p>The numbers tell a story younger generations find unbelievable. Your first house, bought in your mid-twenties, probably cost two to three times your annual salary. Median home price in 1975: <span class=\"stat-box\">$39,300</span>. Median household income: <span class=\"stat-box\">$13,720</span>. <span class=\"hero-callout\">The math worked. A young couple with decent jobs could buy a house, raise children, save for retirement—on one income if necessary. Try that today.</span></p><p>College cost hundreds of dollars per year at state schools, not tens of thousands. Student loans existed but weren't mandatory for middle-class families. You could work a summer job and pay tuition. That sentence sounds like fantasy now. It was your reality.</p><p>Your house appreciated while you slept. The $40,000 investment became $400,000, became $800,000, became whatever the market says today. You didn't do anything to earn that appreciation—you just bought at the right time, held on, and watched the numbers climb. This is generational wealth, and it compounds: your children's down payment, your grandchildren's inheritance, a cushion that accumulates across decades.</p><p>Pensions provided certainty. You worked, contributed, retired, collected until you died. Defined benefit, they called it—the benefit was defined, guaranteed, not subject to market whims. Your company promised, your union negotiated, and the promise was kept. By the time 401(k)s replaced pensions, you'd already built your security. You had decades in the system before the system changed.</p><p>Social Security works for you in ways it might not for younger generations. You paid in for forty years. You'll collect for twenty or more. The actuarial tables favor your cohort. Younger workers funding the system see projections that alarm them: trust fund depletion, benefit cuts, retirement ages rising. They're not wrong to worry. You're not wrong to expect what you were promised. Both things are true and irreconcilable.</p><p>Healthcare costs could consume everything you saved. Long-term care runs <span class=\"stat-box\">$100,000 per year</span>. Medicare doesn't cover it. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The security you built over decades can vanish in a few years of decline.</span> This is the shadow over Boomer finances: you did everything right, and it still might not be enough. Your children see your wealth. You see the bills that could erase it.</p><p>The gap between your generation's assets and those following isn't entirely your doing. You didn't set housing policy or eliminate pensions or inflate college costs. You navigated the system you inherited, made smart choices within it, and built what you could. But the system changed after benefiting you. Understanding this helps conversations with children who seem ungrateful for advantages that no longer exist.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>You did it, so why can't they? This is your generation's defining blind spot—the belief that because the path worked for you, it must still exist. The milestones you hit on schedule now take decades longer, if they happen at all. The bootstrap narrative is powerful and personal and often wrong. The bootstrap got repriced while you weren't looking.</p><p>Your generation came of age when the economy automatically generated prosperity. GDP grew. Wages rose with productivity. A high school diploma meant a middle-class job. These weren't rewards for superior character—they were features of a specific era. The era ended. The expectations didn't update. Younger people face genuinely different conditions, not moral deficiency.</p><p>There's an awkward relationship between the activism of your youth and the politics of your maturity. Many Boomers marched for civil rights, protested Vietnam, demanded transformation. Then the same cohort voted for tax cuts, deregulation, and policies that shredded the safety net. Not everyone did both, but enough did that the contradiction defines your generation. The revolution became an aesthetic. Rebellion became a brand. Woodstock became a credit card commercial.</p><p>Technology isn't the barrier older generations pretend it is. Most of you have adapted—you use smartphones, navigate apps, video-call grandchildren. But there's a subset that treats incompetence as identity: 'I don't do computers.' The world runs on systems you didn't build. Refusing to learn them is a choice, not a personality trait. Your grandchildren will remember who tried and who didn't.</p><p>If you're white, you moved through a society organized around your comfort in ways that were invisible precisely because they were so thorough. If you're a man, doors opened without you noticing the hands that held them closed for others. Acknowledging this doesn't diminish your work. It contextualizes it. You succeeded, and the game was also tilted in your favor. Both things can be true.</p><p>The environmental bill is coming due, and your generation consumed without reckoning. The cars, the flights, the suburban sprawl, the single-use everything—the atmospheric CO2 that climate scientists warned about in the 1980s accumulated while you flew to Cancun. This isn't entirely fair; nobody understood consequences in 1970. But understanding arrived decades ago. Continued denial is a choice with costs your grandchildren will pay.</p><p>Your cohort controls disproportionate wealth, political power, and institutional authority. The average Boomer senator is older than the average Boomer. CEOs, board members, judges, governors—your generation has not relinquished control on any schedule previous generations followed. This creates friction with people waiting for their turn while the turn keeps getting delayed. Awareness won't change this. But it might make Thanksgiving less heated.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1968-1978):</strong> You turned twenty the year everything cracked—1968, assassinations and riots and Vietnam escalating. Your twenties happened during chaos, but the economy held beneath it. Entry-level jobs existed. Pensions accrued. Houses cost what houses were supposed to cost. You got married (probably), started a family (probably), bought your first home (likely). The cultural turmoil was real, but the economic ladder was intact. You climbed it while everything else burned.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1978-1988):</strong> Reagan and recovery. The stagflation seventies gave way to boom times. Your career accelerated. Your salary grew. Your house appreciated. The Cold War droned on, but you'd learned to live with background apocalypse. Your kids were young, your energy was high, and 'Morning in America' felt accurate even if the politics were contested. You were building something—family, security, the life your parents promised was possible.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1988-1998):</strong> Peak earning years coincided with peak optimism. The Berlin Wall fell when you were forty-one. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were forty-three. The enemy you'd feared since childhood simply ceased to exist. The nineties roared. The stock market climbed. The internet emerged as curiosity, then tool, then transformation. Your children were teenagers—difficult, expensive, yours. You were in charge now: of departments, divisions, maybe companies. The baton had passed to your generation. You held it.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (1998-2008):</strong> Y2K worried everyone; nothing happened. Then 9/11 happened—you were fifty-three, old enough to see the pattern of your childhood repeating: another generation's innocence ending in violence and fear. The forever wars began. Your children became adults, maybe married, maybe had children of their own. Grandchildren arrived. Retirement appeared on the horizon, calculable now, real. Then 2008: the financial crisis hit when you were sixty, just as you were preparing to slow down. Portfolios collapsed. Plans delayed. The security you'd built wobbled.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2008-2018):</strong> Retirement arrived for some—pensions intact, timing lucky. For others, continued work because the math no longer worked. Healthcare costs climbed faster than savings could absorb. Bodies started sending invoices: joints, hearts, the machinery wearing. Parents died. Friends died. The actuarial tables became personal, each funeral a calculation you couldn't help making. Politics curdled into something unrecognizable. The world you'd leave your grandchildren looked nothing like the one you'd inherited.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2018+):</strong> You're here now. The pandemic hit your generation hard—age meant vulnerability, and lockdowns meant isolation from the grandchildren who were your reason for enduring. Technology both connects and confuses; you can video-call but the interface changes constantly. Legacy questions surface without invitation: What did your life mean? What worked and what didn't? What are you leaving behind? These aren't morbid questions. They're the natural inventory of a life fully lived. Your generation shaped the world that exists. The verdict on that shaping remains open. History will judge. Your grandchildren already have opinions.</p>"

The entire Boomer cohort spans 1946 to 1964: roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> people, one of the largest generations in American history. You're the beginning of that wave, which means you hit every milestone first: first to overwhelm schools, first to flood job markets, first to reshape culture in your image.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They're your parents, your older siblings, your early bosses. They came of age during Depression and World War II, which made them cautious, institutional, deferential to authority. You questioned everything they accepted. They built careers quietly; you demanded recognition. They saved and endured; you spent and transformed. They think you had it easy. You think they had it rigid. Both perceptions contain truth.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They're your children, or close to it. The 'slacker generation,' the latchkey kids who came home to empty houses because both parents worked—often in jobs you created or managed. Gen X got squeezed: too young for the postwar prosperity that built your wealth, too old for the digital economy that rewarded millennials differently. They've been waiting for their turn at institutional power while you kept the keys. They're not bitter, exactly. They're resigned. They've been overlooked their entire lives; why would that change now?</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The generational warfare is loudest here.</span> You bought houses at twenty-five; they rent at thirty-five. You had pensions; they have student debt averaging <span class=\"stat-box\">$30,000</span>. You accumulated wealth when assets were cheap; they're trying to build while everything costs more. The mutual incomprehension is genuine. You see them as entitled; they see you as oblivious. Neither of you fully grasps the other's economic reality because the numbers changed faster than the narratives did.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Different planets. They've never known a world without internet, without smartphones, without instant answers to every question. You remember party lines and three TV channels and news that arrived once daily. They process information in fragments; you remember when context was assumed. They're anxious in ways that seem foreign—climate dread, economic despair, social media comparison. You're anxious too, but about different threats. Communication across this gap requires patience neither generation consistently provides.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Your generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Your life expectancy at birth was roughly 65 years. You've beaten those odds by decades. Boomers who reach 75 can expect to live into their mid-to-late eighties on average. The extra years are genuine gifts, but they come with costs: healthcare that can consume savings, housing decisions that grow complex, the challenge of remaining relevant in a world your grandchildren understand better than you do.</p><p>Your generation's legacy is contested and will remain so. You inherited a functional society with expanding rights and rising prosperity. You expanded those rights further—civil rights, women's rights, eventually LGBTQ+ rights. You also accumulated unprecedented wealth, much of it locked in housing that younger generations can't access. You consumed resources without reckoning their cost. You built institutions and then defunded them. History will sort this out, eventually. Your grandchildren are already drafting the first verdict. It's mixed. It probably should be.</p>"
