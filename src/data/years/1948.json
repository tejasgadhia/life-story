      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1948-1960</h2><p>You were born the year Harry Truman beat Thomas Dewey in the most famously miscalled election in American history. The Chicago Tribune printed 'DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN' and became a permanent punchline. Your birth year was also when the State of Israel declared independence, Gandhi was assassinated, and the Berlin Blockade forced the first major Cold War showdown. Welcome to the world.</p><p>Your earliest memories formed in the shadow of World War II. The men on your block had served. The women had worked in factories. Nobody talked about trauma because nobody knew that word yet—they just called it 'not talking about the war.' Rationing had ended, but the mentality lingered. Your parents saved aluminum foil and rubber bands like the Nazis might come back any minute.</p><p>You grew up during the great suburban migration. Levittown-style developments sprouted across America, offering GI Bill-financed homes to young families fleeing cramped city apartments. Your childhood probably smelled like fresh paint and new-mown grass in a subdivision where every house looked the same and nobody locked their doors.</p><p>Television arrived in your living room when you were four or five, and it changed everything. Before TV, families gathered around radios. After TV, they gathered around a glowing box that showed them the same programs everyone else was watching. You were part of the first generation to grow up with broadcast media as a constant companion. Howdy Doody, Captain Kangaroo, and The Mickey Mouse Club were your shared cultural touchstones.</p><p>Polio was the pandemic of your childhood. Summers meant staying away from swimming pools and crowds. The iron lung was a real fear. When Jonas Salk's vaccine arrived in 1955, you were seven—old enough to remember the relief that swept through every household in America.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That's roughly 76 million Americans—the largest generation until Millennials caught up. Your cohort was so massive it reshaped every institution it touched: schools built additions, colleges expanded, and the job market swelled to accommodate you.</p><p>You're not just a Boomer—you're an early Boomer, part of the first wave born in the post-war euphoria. This matters because early Boomers had different experiences than those born in 1960. You came of age during the Kennedy era, not the Nixon years. You turned twenty in 1968, the year Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, the year Chicago police beat protesters at the Democratic convention, the year everything felt like it might collapse into chaos.</p><p>Your generation invented youth culture as a marketable concept. Before Boomers, teenagers were just short adults waiting to grow up. Your cohort created rock and roll as a lifestyle, civil rights as a generational project, and counterculture as a viable alternative to your parents' conformity. Or at least, that's the mythology.</p><p>The truth is more complicated. Most Boomers didn't go to Woodstock. Most didn't march for civil rights. Most took jobs, bought houses, raised families, and became their parents faster than they expected. The revolutionary Boomer is a real figure, but it's also a carefully curated self-image that obscures the silent majority who just went along with things.</p><p>Your generation's defining trauma was the Kennedy assassination. You were fifteen. You remember where you were when you heard. Every Boomer does. That moment ended a certain kind of American innocence—the belief that the good guys always win and the future is always brighter.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year the 33 1/3 RPM long-playing record was introduced, which meant you'd grow up with albums, not just singles. The LP transformed music into an art form with sequencing, themes, and side A versus side B. Your generation's albums—Sgt. Pepper, Pet Sounds, Kind of Blue—were designed as complete experiences.</p><p>The year 1948 also gave us Milton Berle on television, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Laurence Olivier's Hamlet winning Best Picture. Ed Sullivan started his variety show that year, which would later introduce America to Elvis and the Beatles. You were there from the beginning of broadcast entertainment.</p><p>Your childhood was the golden age of radio drama, transitioning into the golden age of television. You listened to The Lone Ranger and The Shadow, then watched I Love Lucy and Father Knows Best. The move from audio to visual imagination happened during your formative years, which explains why Boomers can still describe radio shows they heard seventy years ago.</p><p>By the time you were a teenager, rock and roll had arrived. Elvis on Ed Sullivan in 1956 (you were eight). Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard—the sound that scandalized your parents became the soundtrack of your adolescence. When the Beatles landed in 1964, you were sixteen and primed for the British Invasion.</p><p>Your twenties belonged to the counterculture: Woodstock (1969), the Summer of Love, psychedelic rock, protest music. You might have been there, or you might have watched from the suburbs, but either way, the soundtrack of your young adulthood was unprecedented. Nobody had ever heard anything like Hendrix, Joplin, or the Doors before. They emerged from your generation's collective consciousness.</p><p>Movies in your formative years ranged from Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments to Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate. You witnessed Hollywood's transformation from spectacle to art house, from Technicolor epics to gritty New Hollywood realism. By your thirties, you were watching Jaws and Star Wars—films your kids would memorize.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born before the transistor replaced the vacuum tube, before commercial jet travel, before satellites, before computers shrank from room-sized to pocket-sized. The technological transformation you've witnessed is arguably greater than any generation in human history.</p><p>Your childhood had party lines and rotary phones. Long-distance calls were expensive events. You'd shout 'It's long-distance!' and everyone would gather around. Television was black-and-white, three channels, and signed off at midnight with the national anthem. Color TV arrived when you were about fifteen, and it felt like magic.</p><p>You were ten when Sputnik launched in 1957, starting the Space Race. You were twenty-one when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969. You watched Armstrong's first steps live on TV, in a time when 'live on TV' was still a relatively new concept. Your generation put humans on the moon and then got bored and stopped going.</p><p>Computers entered your workplace in your thirties and forties, initially as intimidating mainframes, then as desktop machines. You learned to type on a keyboard after decades of using typewriters. You adapted to email after a lifetime of memos and phone calls. The learning curve was steep, but you climbed it.</p><p>The internet arrived when you were in your late forties. Smartphones in your late fifties. Social media in your sixties. You've adopted technologies that would have seemed like science fiction when you were young. Your grandchildren don't appreciate what a profound shift this represents. They think Wi-Fi is a law of nature.</p><p>Your generation's relationship with technology is one of continuous adaptation. You weren't born digital, but you've become fluent through decades of forced immersion. You remember what life was like before screens ruled everything—and you're not entirely sure the screens are an improvement.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born into the early Cold War, when nuclear annihilation seemed not just possible but likely. By the time you were old enough to understand the news, the Korean War was underway. You practiced duck-and-cover drills at school, as if hiding under a desk would save you from an atomic bomb. The fear was constant, background noise for your entire childhood.</p><p>You were fifteen when JFK was assassinated in Dallas. That Friday afternoon is seared into your memory. School stopped. Adults cried in public. The funeral procession played on every channel for days. You learned that Presidents could be killed, that the American story wasn't always triumphant, that bad things happened to good people without reason.</p><p>Your twenties were turbulent. MLK assassinated in 1968, you were twenty. RFK assassinated two months later. Vietnam escalated while you were draft age. Some of your classmates went. Some came back changed. Some didn't come back. The war wasn't an abstraction—it was a daily body count on the evening news, a lottery that might pull your number.</p><p>You were twenty-one during the Chicago convention riots, twenty-one during Woodstock, twenty-two when the National Guard killed four students at Kent State. The late sixties felt like the country might genuinely tear itself apart. Looking back, maybe it did.</p><p>Watergate consumed your mid-twenties. You watched the hearings, followed the scandal, saw a President resign in disgrace. The cynicism it bred never fully lifted. 'All politicians are crooks' became conventional wisdom because you'd seen proof.</p><p>The oil crisis of 1973 hit when you were twenty-five. Gas lines, rationing, a president in a cardigan telling you to turn down the heat. American exceptionalism took a beating. The unlimited abundance of your childhood suddenly had limits.</p><p>By your forties, Reagan was president, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War you'd lived under your entire life simply ended. You'd prepared for nuclear war for forty years, and then one day the other side just... stopped existing.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the late 1960s or early 1970s, a time of relative prosperity with functioning safety nets. Jobs came with pensions, health insurance, and the reasonable expectation of lifetime employment. You could support a family on one income. College was affordable. Upward mobility wasn't a fantasy—it was a reasonable expectation.</p><p>Your career probably followed a predictable arc: entry-level position, steady promotions, management by your thirties, executive by your forties. Loyalty was rewarded. You stayed at companies for decades. The idea of 'job-hopping' was a sign of instability, not ambition.</p><p>Women of your generation entered the professional workforce in unprecedented numbers, breaking barriers while fighting for basic respect. If you're a woman, you probably dealt with sexism so casual it didn't even register as sexism—it was just how things were. Glass ceilings were invisible until you hit them.</p><p>You survived the stagflation of the 1970s, the recessions of the early 1980s, the corporate restructuring of the 1990s. Each economic shock taught you that security was conditional. By the time you were ready to retire, pensions had been converted to 401(k)s, and the deal you'd expected had been rewritten without your consent.</p><p>Your generation built the companies and institutions that exist today, for better and worse. You designed the systems that Millennials inherited and now complain about. This creates friction. You did what you were supposed to do. You followed the rules. Why can't they?</p><p>The answer is that the rules changed, but that's hard to see from inside your experience. The ladder you climbed has rungs missing now. The doors you walked through have gatekeepers your successors can't get past. The economy that worked for you doesn't work the same way anymore.</p>"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You probably married young by modern standards—early to mid-twenties was typical. Dating meant actual dates: picking someone up, going somewhere, spending money, meeting parents. There were rules, roles, and expectations that everyone understood, even if nobody liked them.</p><p>Your generation's divorce rate was the highest in American history, peaking in the 1980s. The sexual revolution, women's liberation, and changing economic realities destabilized marriages that previous generations had endured in silent misery. Freedom to leave meant people left. Whether that's progress or tragedy depends on who you ask.</p><p>Communication in your relationships happened face-to-face and via phone. Long-distance relationships required letters and expensive phone calls. You couldn't text. You couldn't video chat. If someone was far away, they were genuinely far away. Absence meant absence, not just a different time zone on a screen.</p><p>Your generation raised children before helicopter parenting became standard. Kids played outside until dark. Supervision was loose. The neighborhood was the boundary. You probably can't understand the anxiety modern parents have, the monitoring, the scheduling, the constant vigilance. It seems excessive. Maybe it is.</p><p>Friendship in your generation was local and enduring. You knew the same people for decades. Reunions meant something because you hadn't seen people in years. Social media changed this—suddenly everyone from your past was accessible, their daily lives documented in posts you didn't ask for. It's both more connected and less intimate than what you knew.</p><p>Your relationship with your own children is probably complicated. You gave them more than your parents gave you, but they still struggle. The economy you thrived in doesn't function the same way. Their frustration can feel like ingratitude. Their frustration might be legitimate. Both things can be true.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You grew up with Depression-era parents who saved compulsively, distrusted banks, and remembered when money was worthless. Their anxiety shaped your habits even as abundance made the anxiety seem outdated. You learned to save before you learned to spend.</p><p>Your generation accumulated wealth in ways that seem impossible now. Houses cost two or three times annual salary, not ten times. College cost hundreds of dollars, not tens of thousands. Pensions provided guaranteed income in retirement. The math worked differently.</p><p>You probably bought your first house in your twenties, watched it appreciate for decades, and now sit on an asset worth five or ten times what you paid. This is generational wealth your children can't replicate because the prices you benefited from no longer exist.</p><p>The stock market treated you well overall. You invested during the long bull market of the 1980s and 1990s. Yes, there were crashes—1987, 2000, 2008—but the overall trajectory rewarded patience. Your 401(k) probably recovered. Your timeline was long enough to absorb the shocks.</p><p>Social Security will likely pay out for you in ways it won't for younger generations. You paid in for decades. You'll collect for decades. The actuarial tables work in your favor. This creates tension with younger workers who suspect they're funding your retirement without any guarantee of their own.</p><p>Your financial psychology is shaped by abundance followed by anxiety. You worked hard, saved diligently, invested wisely—and now worry it won't be enough. Healthcare costs alone could consume your savings. Long-term care is ruinously expensive. The security you earned feels fragile in ways you didn't expect.</p><p>The wealth gap between your generation and those following isn't your fault, exactly. You didn't rig the system. You just happened to arrive when the system was rigged in your favor. Understanding this might help conversations with younger family members who seem ungrateful for advantages they don't have.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest strength—self-determination, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps—is also its greatest blind spot. You did it, so why can't they? This logic ignores that the conditions enabling your success no longer exist. The bootstrap itself has been priced out of reach.</p><p>You came of age when economic growth was automatic, when a high school diploma could secure a middle-class life, when hard work reliably translated into advancement. These were features of your era, not universal laws. Younger generations face genuinely different circumstances, not deficient character.</p><p>Your generation has an uneasy relationship with the activism of your youth. Many Boomers marched for civil rights, protested Vietnam, and demanded change—then voted for tax cuts and deregulation that hollowed out the social safety net. The revolution became a lifestyle brand. Rebellion became a marketing category.</p><p>Technology intimidation is real but often overstated. Many Boomers have adapted brilliantly to digital life. But some cling to obsolete habits and dismiss new tools as fads. The world runs on systems you didn't build and don't fully understand. Admitting this isn't weakness—it's honesty.</p><p>Your generation tends to underestimate structural barriers. If you're white, you moved through a society designed around your comfort. If you're a man, doors opened that stayed closed for others. Recognizing this doesn't diminish your accomplishments—it contextualizes them.</p><p>The environmental bill is coming due. Your generation's consumption—the cars, the flights, the suburban sprawl, the cheap plastic everything—has consequences that younger generations will inherit. This isn't a moral failing, exactly. Nobody understood climate change in 1970. But understanding has arrived, and resistance to change is a choice.</p><p>Your generation controls disproportionate wealth, political power, and institutional authority. This creates resentment, fairly or not. Younger people waiting for their turn are watching the turn get delayed again and again. Awareness of this dynamic might not change it, but it could make family dinners less contentious.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1968-1978):</strong> You came of age during chaos—assassinations, war, protests, Watergate. You probably served in Vietnam or knew people who did. You married, started a family, bought a house. Despite the turmoil, the economic fundamentals held. Entry-level jobs paid living wages. Housing was affordable. The future, however uncertain, still seemed bright.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1978-1988):</strong> The Reagan years. Morning in America. You were established now—career, family, mortgage. The economy recovered from the 1970s malaise. Your income grew. Your house appreciated. You were building the life your parents promised. The Cold War was still cold, but you'd learned to live with the background fear.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1988-1998):</strong> Peak earning years. The Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. The enemy you'd feared your whole life simply evaporated. The 1990s brought unprecedented prosperity. The internet emerged. Your kids were teenagers. You were in charge now—of companies, communities, families. The baton had passed to your generation.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (1998-2008):</strong> Y2K came and went. 9/11 changed everything. The forever wars began. Your children became adults, maybe got married, maybe had kids of their own. Retirement appeared on the horizon. You started counting years rather than assuming them. The 2008 financial crisis hit just as you were preparing to slow down. Many Boomers lost retirement savings, delayed plans, watched the security they'd built become suddenly fragile.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2008-2018):</strong> Retirement, maybe. Or continued work because the math no longer worked. Healthcare costs climbed. Bodies started breaking in ways that couldn't be ignored. Parents died. Friends died. The actuarial tables became personal. Politics grew angrier. The world your grandchildren are inheriting looks nothing like the one you expected to leave them.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2018+):</strong> You're here now, or approaching. The pandemic hit your generation hard—vulnerability plus the isolation of lockdowns. Technology both connects and confuses. Legacy questions surface: What did your life mean? What are you leaving behind? These aren't morbid questions—they're the natural reckoning of a life fully lived. Your generation shaped the modern world. The verdict on that shaping remains disputed.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.5 million people born in 1948, part of the first wave of the Baby Boom. The entire Boomer generation is about 76 million Americans, making it one of the largest generations in history.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were louder, more numerous, and more demanding. The Silent Generation deferred to authority; you questioned it. They built careers quietly; you expected recognition. They endured; you transformed. Whether you improved on their example depends on your definition of improvement.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more numerous, wealthier, and more institutionally powerful. Gen X was the 'slacker' generation, the latchkey kids who raised themselves while you worked. They're sandwiched between your dominance and Millennial activism, often overlooked, quietly resentful. They've been waiting for their turn at the wheel while you kept driving.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the contrast is stark. You bought houses at 25; they rent at 35. You had pensions; they have student debt. You accumulated wealth when assets were cheap; they're trying to accumulate while assets are expensive. The economic circumstances are genuinely different, though both sides struggle to see past their own experience.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. They've never known a world without internet, without screens, without constant connectivity. You remember rotary phones, three TV channels, and news that arrived once a day. The gap in lived experience is vast. Communication across it requires patience neither generation always has.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 65 years. If you've made it to 2024, you've beaten those odds significantly—average Boomers reaching 75 can expect to live into their mid-to-late 80s. The extra years are a gift, but they come with costs: healthcare, housing, the challenge of remaining relevant in a world that's moved on.</p><p>Your generation's legacy is contested. You inherited a functional society and... well, opinions vary on what you did with it. You expanded rights, embraced diversity, built unprecedented wealth. You also accelerated climate change, accumulated debt, and pulled up ladders behind you. History will judge. Your grandchildren already are.</p>"
