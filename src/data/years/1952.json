      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1952-1964</h2><p>You were born the year Dwight D. Eisenhower won the presidency in a landslide, promising to end the Korean War. Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television that same year, which seems quaint now but was revolutionary then—kids could actually ask their parents for specific products they'd seen on the magical glowing box in the living room.</p><p>Your childhood was peak postwar optimism. The GI Bill had created a middle class. Suburbs were sprouting like dandelions. Every other house had a new Chevy in the driveway. Your parents had survived the Depression and the war; they wanted normalcy, stability, and a yard. They got Levittown.</p><p>You were two when Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation unconstitutional. Four when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. Eight when four Black students sat down at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro. The civil rights movement wasn't abstract history—it was happening on the evening news while you ate dinner.</p><p>Polio was the great terror of your early childhood. You probably knew kids who had it, or knew families who knew families. Dr. Jonas Salk's vaccine arrived when you were three, and suddenly the swimming pools reopened. That collective exhale of relief shaped how your generation thinks about vaccines and public health.</p><p>Television defined your childhood in ways no generation before could understand. You watched Howdy Doody, Captain Kangaroo, The Mickey Mouse Club. The whole family gathered around one screen because there was only one screen. Programming ended at midnight with the national anthem and a test pattern. Entertainment had limits.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That's roughly 76 million Americans—the largest generation in history until the Millennials showed up. You're named after the post-WWII baby boom, when returning soldiers and their grateful spouses got busy rebuilding the population.</p><p>Your generation's defining trait is sheer size. There were so many of you that everything had to expand to accommodate you—schools, colleges, housing, jobs. You bent the culture to your needs simply by existing. When you were young, the country was young. When you aged, the country aged. Social Security started sweating when you approached retirement.</p><p>The 1960s were your crucible. You were a teenager during the Kennedy assassination, old enough to understand that something fundamental had broken. You came of age during Vietnam, the civil rights movement, women's liberation, and Watergate. You watched the country's institutions crack under pressure and never quite trusted them the same way again.</p><p>Boomers get blamed for a lot—wrecking the economy, hoarding wealth, destroying the planet, voting badly. Some of that's fair. Some of it ignores the Boomers who marched for civil rights, protested Vietnam, and pushed for environmental regulations. Your generation is complicated. Every generation is.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Singin' in the Rain made everyone believe Gene Kelly could actually dance in a downpour. High Noon turned Gary Cooper into the template for stoic American masculinity. The Greatest Show on Earth won Best Picture, which nobody remembers because it's one of the worst Best Picture winners in history.</p><p>Radio was still king in 1952, but television was coming for its crown. Dragnet moved from radio to TV. I Love Lucy was the most-watched show in America. Your family probably got their first television set sometime in your childhood, and it changed everything. Suddenly the whole country was watching the same things at the same time.</p><p>Rock and roll arrived when you were about three. Elvis Presley exploded onto the scene when you were four. Your parents thought he was scandalous. You thought he was the future. By the time you were a teenager, the Beatles had landed at JFK, and the screaming fans were your peers.</p><p>Your adolescence was soundtracked by the British Invasion, Motown, Bob Dylan going electric, the Summer of Love. You were sixteen during Woodstock, even if you weren't actually there. (Hardly anyone was actually there who claims to have been there.) The music of your youth wasn't just entertainment—it was political, countercultural, generational warfare set to a backbeat.</p><p>Movies in your formative years went from biblical epics and musicals to Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate. The rating system replaced the Hays Code when you were sixteen. Suddenly films could show things your parents' movies couldn't. Culture was loosening up, and you were the target demographic.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born before computers existed in any meaningful sense. UNIVAC had predicted Eisenhower's election victory that year, which seemed like sorcery. The computer that did it filled an entire room and had less processing power than a modern greeting card.</p><p>The technology of your childhood was mechanical, not digital. Rotary phones. Manual typewriters. Adding machines with actual cranks. Television was the only 'high tech' in most homes, and even that was black and white until you were about ten. Color TV existed but cost more than a car.</p><p>You were twelve when the first communications satellite, Telstar, relayed a television signal across the Atlantic. Sixteen when the first handheld calculator was invented. Seventeen when humans walked on the moon. The pace of technological change during your youth was staggering—you went from no television to moon landings in less than two decades.</p><p>You learned to type on a typewriter, probably in high school. Mistakes meant Wite-Out or starting over. There was no delete key, no undo button. This shaped how you think about work—measure twice, cut once, because corrections were expensive.</p><p>The personal computer arrived when you were in your thirties. The internet became mainstream when you were in your forties. Smartphones showed up when you were in your fifties. You've adapted to more technological change than any generation in human history, and younger people still treat you like you can't figure out how to unmute yourself on Zoom.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were one when the Korean War ended. Two when the Army-McCarthy hearings exposed Joe McCarthy as a bully and a fraud. Three when Rosa Parks refused to move. The civil rights movement wasn't something you read about later—it was the background noise of your childhood.</p><p>You were eleven when JFK was assassinated. You probably remember where you were. Everyone your age does. That moment divided history into before and after. The optimism of the early 1960s curdled into something darker, and it never fully recovered.</p><p>You were sixteen when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated within two months of each other in 1968. You were seventeen during Woodstock and the Manson murders. Your late teens were chaos—riots, assassinations, a war that kept escalating despite protests. The establishment was cracking.</p><p>Vietnam defined your young adulthood. You were draft eligible. You either went, got a deferment, protested, or moved to Canada. There was no neutral position. The war ended when you were twenty-three, but the divisions it created never fully healed.</p><p>Watergate happened when you were twenty-one. You watched a president resign in disgrace. The institutions your parents had trusted—government, the military, the presidency—had proven themselves corrupt. Your generation's skepticism of authority has roots in watching Nixon sweat on television.</p><p>You were twenty-one during the oil crisis and twenty-seven during the Iranian hostage crisis. The 1970s were a decade of malaise, stagflation, and disco. America seemed to be declining. Then Reagan showed up promising morning again, and you were thirty-two. Old enough to vote for him, young enough to still be paying the bill for his policies.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the early 1970s, which wasn't great timing. The economy was struggling with stagflation—high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously, which economists had thought was impossible. The oil crisis made everything worse. The postwar boom your parents enjoyed was over.</p><p>But you had advantages. College was affordable—you could actually work your way through without loans. A single income could support a family. Pensions existed. Companies hired you with the expectation that you'd stay for thirty years, and they'd take care of you in return. That deal held, mostly, for your cohort.</p><p>Women of your generation entered the professional workforce in unprecedented numbers. The pill had arrived when you were eight. Title IX passed when you were twenty. Women could have careers that didn't involve typing pools or nursing. The glass ceiling existed, but at least women were in the building.</p><p>You probably worked for fewer employers than younger generations do. Job-hopping was considered disloyal, not strategic. You climbed ladders instead of jumping between them. Loyalty was rewarded with promotions, pensions, and gold watches at retirement.</p><p>By the time you were in your forties, the rules were changing. Downsizing became corporate strategy. Pensions converted to 401(k)s. Lifetime employment became a quaint memory. You were established enough to mostly survive these changes, but you watched younger colleagues get chewed up by the new economy.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You grew up in an era when dating meant your father met the young man at the door. Courtship had scripts. You went steady, you got pinned, you got engaged. Relationships had stages that everyone understood, and violating the sequence had consequences.</p><p>The sexual revolution happened during your formative years. The pill became widely available when you were eight. By the time you were dating seriously, the rules your parents had followed were suggestions at best. Free love was the rhetoric, though the reality was more complicated for women who bore the consequences of that freedom.</p><p>You probably married younger than today's young people do. The average marriage age in 1975 was 21 for women, 23 for men. By those standards, waiting until 25 made you practically middle-aged. Marriage was the default, and staying single past your mid-twenties raised eyebrows.</p><p>Communication in your youth was face-to-face, by phone, or by letter. Long-distance calls were expensive—you timed them. Love letters were actual letters, written by hand, mailed with stamps. Breaking up required a conversation, not a text. There was no ghosting when everyone knew everyone.</p><p>Divorce rates climbed during your adulthood. The stigma faded. Women gained financial independence. No-fault divorce became available. Your generation normalized ending bad marriages instead of enduring them. Whether that was liberation or tragedy depends on who you ask.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents survived the Great Depression. That shaped everything about how they handled money—save obsessively, waste nothing, trust no one with your finances. You inherited that caution, even if you never lived through the same scarcity.</p><p>You entered adulthood during economic turbulence—the oil crisis, stagflation, high interest rates. But you also bought houses when they cost $30,000 and watched them appreciate to $300,000. You invested in a stock market that, despite crashes, trended relentlessly upward over your lifetime. Time was on your side.</p><p>Your generation accumulated wealth that subsequent generations can only dream about. You benefited from affordable education, cheap housing, generous pensions, and a labor market that rewarded loyalty. The ladder you climbed got pulled up behind you, though that wasn't your fault.</p><p>Social Security and Medicare existed for your entire working life. You paid in, expecting to collect. You're collecting now, or will be soon. Whether those programs will exist for your grandchildren is an open question, but you'll be fine. You got yours.</p><p>The financial anxieties of Millennials and Gen Z seem foreign to you. Houses cost more than a year's salary? Student loans that take decades to repay? Retirement that might never happen? You worked hard, sure, but you also worked in an economy that rewarded hard work. That economy doesn't exist anymore.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest weakness is the assumption that the world you succeeded in still exists. You tell younger people to work hard, save money, buy a house—advice that made perfect sense when houses cost two years' salary and college didn't require loans. The math has changed. The advice hasn't.</p><p>You tend to underestimate how much easier things were. Not easy—you worked hard. But affordable college, available jobs, cheap housing, and pensions made a middle-class life achievable through normal effort. That's no longer true, and your incredulity at younger generations' struggles comes across as tone-deaf.</p><p>Your generation has a complicated relationship with race. You lived through the civil rights movement, and many of you supported it. But you also fled to suburbs, opposed busing, and built systems that perpetuated inequality while maintaining plausible deniability. The distance between your stated values and your neighborhoods tells a story.</p><p>You're skeptical of institutions, but you also run most of them. Congress, corporate boards, newsrooms, universities—Boomers are still in charge, even as you complain about the establishment. Your generation is the establishment. The call is coming from inside the house.</p><p>Climate change is your blind spot. You'll be gone before the worst of it hits, and your generation has been notably unwilling to sacrifice for a future you won't see. The planet you're leaving behind is measurably worse than the one you inherited, and your grandchildren will live with the consequences.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1972-1982):</strong> You entered adulthood during the hangover from the 1960s. Vietnam ended. Nixon resigned. The economy stagnated. Disco happened. You got your first real job, probably got married, maybe had kids. The optimism of your youth had curdled into cynicism, but you were too busy building a life to dwell on it. This was your decade of foundations—career, family, mortgage.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1982-1992):</strong> Reagan's America. The economy recovered. Yuppies emerged. Wall Street became respectable again. You were hitting your stride professionally, climbing corporate ladders or building businesses. Your kids were in school. You bought a bigger house. The Cold War ended right as you turned forty, and the future looked bright. This was your decade of accumulation.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1992-2002):</strong> Clinton, the tech boom, the dot-com bubble. You were in your peak earning years. Your kids were teenagers, which was its own challenge. You started thinking about retirement, maybe buying that vacation property. The economy seemed unstoppable. Then 9/11 happened as you approached fifty, and the world got darker again. This was your decade of peak prosperity.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2002-2012):</strong> The War on Terror. The housing bubble. The 2008 crash. You were close enough to retirement to watch your 401(k) crater with real panic. Your kids were adults now, maybe struggling in ways that confused you. The economy you'd thrived in was breaking. You started counting down to retirement while wondering if you could still afford it. This was your decade of uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2012-2022):</strong> You retired, or you didn't. Some of your friends died. Your parents died, if they hadn't already. You became the oldest generation in your family, which is a strange feeling. The world changed in ways that felt alien—smartphones everywhere, politics unrecognizable, culture moving on without you. This was your decade of letting go.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2022+):</strong> You're here now. You've lived through more history than most humans ever do—from Eisenhower to Biden, from no TV to smartphones, from segregation to a Black president. Your body doesn't work like it used to. Your friends are dying. But you're still here, still watching, still adapting to a world that keeps changing. Not bad for a kid who grew up with Mr. Potato Head.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.9 million people born in 1952. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million Americans, which made you the largest generation in history until Millennials came along.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were louder. They came of age during the Depression and WWII, which taught them caution and conformity. You came of age during the 1960s, which taught you to question everything. They trusted institutions. You burned draft cards.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had it easier economically. They graduated into recessions and got labeled slackers for struggling. You had affordable college, available jobs, and pensions. They got downsizing, outsourcing, and 401(k)s. They're the cleanup crew for the mess you made.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. You controlled 21% of the nation's wealth when you were their age. They control 7%. You bought houses for $30,000. They can't afford rent. You had pensions. They have student loans. The economic ladder you climbed got pulled up behind you.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you might as well be from different planets. They've never known a world without the internet, without school shootings, without climate anxiety. They're more diverse, more tolerant, more skeptical of the American Dream. They look at your generation and see the people who broke everything.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 68 years. You've beaten that. Modern medicine, better nutrition, and sheer luck have given your generation more healthy years than any before. You're redefining old age, staying active into your seventies and eighties. The question isn't whether you'll live long—it's what kind of world you'll leave behind.</p>"
