      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1952-1964</h2><p>Children born in 1952 arrived in the middle of the Eisenhower era, a period that advertised itself as calm and prosperous and, for many white suburban families, delivered on that promise. Their parents had survived depression and war and were now deeply invested in the project of normalcy — mortgages, PTA meetings, church suppers, station wagons in driveways. The suburbs were still new enough that the concrete hadn't quite settled, the trees hadn't grown tall, and entire neighborhoods had the feeling of a stage set being assembled in real time.</p><p>These children grew up at the center of American domestic life's most standardized era. Their mothers' days followed rhythms so consistent they could have been charted: laundry on Monday, ironing on Tuesday, shopping on Thursday. Their fathers existed primarily as evening and weekend figures — men who left before breakfast and returned in time for dinner, whose authority was invoked ('Wait until your father gets home') more often than it was exercised. The emotional climate was temperate by design. Conflict was managed quietly. Vulnerability was kept private. Children learned early that composure was the family's most valued currency.</p><p>The polio vaccine arrived when they were three, ending a terror that had shaped their earliest years. Before Salk, every summer carried a specific dread — public pools were suspect, crowds were dangerous, and every childhood fever could be the beginning of something devastating. The vaccine campaigns that followed were among the most organized public health efforts in American history, and these children participated in them at school, lining up in gymnasiums to receive the shots that would make summer safe again. The experience left an imprint: science could solve the problems that frightened adults most.</p><p>At five, Sputnik rattled the country's confidence and reorganized their education. The satellite was a Soviet achievement, but its consequences landed in American classrooms. These children were among the first to experience the post-Sputnik curriculum push — the 'New Math,' the emphasis on science, the sense that learning was now a patriotic obligation. Teachers who had been generalists became, overnight, agents of national competitiveness. The shift was disorienting for some families and exhilarating for others, but all children felt the increased pressure, even if they couldn't name its source.</p><p>At ten, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the Cold War to its most dangerous point. For thirteen days in October 1962, the adults were genuinely afraid — not the managed, bureaucratic fear of duck-and-cover drills, but something rawer and more personal. Children sensed it in their parents' voices, in the unusual frequency of news bulletins, in the charged silence at dinner tables. The crisis passed without war, but it left a residue. These children understood, at ten, that the comfortable world they inhabited could be erased by decisions made by men they would never meet, in rooms they would never enter.</p><p>By twelve, the postwar consensus that had organized their childhood was beginning to crack. The civil rights movement had moved from courtrooms to streets. The president who had seemed to embody the country's youth and possibility was dead. The orderly, predictable America of their early childhood — the one with clear rules and confident adults and a future that looked like a shinier version of the present — was giving way to something more turbulent, more uncertain, and more honest about the contradictions it had always contained.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The term was coined to describe the demographic explosion when <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans arrived between 1946 and 1964—soldiers came home, the economy boomed, and everyone got busy making families. This generation was so large that schools had to build new wings, colleges expanded enrollment, and the entire culture bent to accommodate their needs simply because there were so many of them.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers born in 1952 were eleven when President Kennedy was assassinated. November 22, 1963. Sixth grade.</span> They probably watched the news coverage for four straight days—Walter Cronkite removing his glasses, Jackie's pink suit, little John-John's salute. The optimism of the early 1960s curdled that weekend. Before: Camelot, the Space Race, a young president who made the future feel possible. After: a world where presidents could be shot in broad daylight and nothing was certain.</p><p>This generation spans 1946 to 1964—the largest generation in American history until Millennials surpassed them. They bent markets, politics, and culture to their will through sheer numbers. When they needed schools, schools were built. When they needed jobs, the economy expanded. When they reached retirement age, Social Security actuaries started having anxiety attacks.</p><p>This cohort was seventeen during the Summer of Love, eighteen when Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated two months apart, nineteen during Woodstock. Their late teens were chaos—the Tet Offensive, the Chicago convention riots, the Manson murders, Cambodia. The establishment their parents had built was cracking, and they were the ones with sledgehammers.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">Boomers are blamed for a lot now—hoarding wealth, pulling up ladders, voting for policies that benefited them at the expense of their grandchildren.</span> Some of that's fair. Some of it ignores the Boomers who marched at Selma, burned draft cards, and pushed for environmental protections. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> This generation is complicated.

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Singin' in the Rain came out in 1952—Gene Kelly splashing through puddles in a way that made everyone believe joy was possible even in a downpour. High Noon gave Gary Cooper to stoic American masculinity. The Greatest Show on Earth won Best Picture, which reveals what Hollywood thought audiences wanted: spectacle, circuses, elephants. These weren't children's movies, but they played on television throughout childhood until children absorbed them like background radiation.</p><p>Pop culture education started with television's golden age. At two, children were watching I Love Lucy when 44 million Americans tuned in to see Little Ricky born—more people than watched Eisenhower's inauguration. At four, Dragnet taught that crime didn't pay and detectives talked in monotone. At six, children discovered The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and Father Knows Best, shows that presented a version of family life so wholesome it bordered on science fiction.</p><p>At four, a truck driver from Memphis named Elvis Presley walked into Sun Records, and nothing was ever the same. By the time children were five, 'Heartbreak Hotel' was everywhere—on the radio, on Ed Sullivan (from the waist up only), in older siblings' bedrooms where parents couldn't hear. Parents thought he was vulgar. Children thought he was electric. The generational battle lines were drawn over a pelvis.</p><p>High school was the British Invasion. This cohort was twelve when the Beatles landed at JFK, when 73 million people watched them on Ed Sullivan, when female classmates screamed until they lost their voices. The Rolling Stones were dirtier, Dylan was deeper, but the Beatles were first. Everyone knew every word to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' before they'd ever held anyone's hand.</p><p>At fifteen, Motown was everything—the Supremes, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder. At sixteen, the Beach Boys made teenagers want to surf even if they'd never seen an ocean. At seventeen, Woodstock happened and half a million people gathered in a muddy field while teenagers watched the news coverage and told themselves they would have gone if they could have. (They probably wouldn't have. Almost nobody who claims they were there actually was.)</p><p>Movies in teenage years shifted from biblical epics to something rawer. At fifteen, Bonnie and Clyde made violence beautiful and outlaws sympathetic. At sixteen, The Graduate taught that plastics weren't the future and neither was Mrs. Robinson's advice. The Hays Code collapsed when this cohort was sixteen, replaced by the rating system. Suddenly films could show things parents' movies couldn't even acknowledge existed.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The whir of a rotary phone dial returning to zero. The clack of typewriter keys striking ribbon against paper. The static hiss before a radio program began. Childhood was mechanical, analog, physical—every technology had moving parts that could be seen and sounds that could be identified.</p><p>At birth, UNIVAC predicted Eisenhower's election victory on CBS, which seemed like witchcraft to parents. That computer filled an entire room and had less processing power than the greeting card that will play 'Happy Birthday' at a party. The word 'computer' meant a person who did calculations, usually a woman with a slide rule.</p><p>Television was the transformative technology of childhood, and Boomers were the first generation to grow up with it as standard equipment. Families probably got their first set when children were three or four—a heavy wooden cabinet with a tiny screen, rabbit ears that needed constant adjusting, and programming that ended at midnight with the national anthem and a test pattern. By seven, over 50 million American homes had one. The whole country started watching the same things at the same time for the first time in human history.</p><p>At five, Sputnik crossed the night sky and everything changed. Children were too young to fully understand the fear—that the Soviets could put something in orbit meant they could put a bomb anywhere—but they felt parents' anxiety. Space became a national obsession. Children would grow up wanting to be an astronaut, or knowing someone who did.</p><p>At ten, children watched Alan Shepard's fifteen-minute suborbital flight. At eleven, John Glenn orbited the Earth three times. At seventeen, they watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon, probably on that same television set that had shown Howdy Doody, and the world parents had grown up in became ancient history.</p><p>Boomers learned to type on a manual typewriter, probably in high school business class. Mistakes meant Wite-Out or carbon paper nightmares or starting over completely. There was no delete key, no undo, no drafts saved automatically. This shaped how this generation thinks about work—measure twice, cut once, because corrections cost time and money.</p><p>The transistor radio arrived when this cohort was six, and suddenly music was portable. The pocket calculator when they were twenty, making slide rules obsolete overnight. The personal computer when they were twenty-nine, the internet when they were forty-three, the smartphone when they were fifty-five. Boomers have adapted to more technological change than any generation in history, from party lines to FaceTime, from letters that took weeks to texts that arrive instantly. And somehow, younger people still act like Boomers can't figure out how to unmute themselves on Zoom.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Children were two when the Army-McCarthy hearings played out on live television—Senator Joe McCarthy bullying witnesses, Joseph Welch finally asking 'Have you no sense of decency?'—and parents watched American paranoia peak and then collapse in real time. The Red Scare that had gripped the country began to loosen its hold. Children were too young to understand, but the adults around them exhaled.</p><p>At three, Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat in Montgomery. At eight, four Black college students sat down at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro and refused to leave. At eleven, Bull Connor turned fire hoses and attack dogs on children in Birmingham. The civil rights movement wasn't something children read about in history class—it was on television every night while families ate meatloaf and mashed potatoes.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At eleven, Kennedy was assassinated—November 22, 1963.

This cohort was seventeen during the Chicago Democratic Convention riots, where police beat protesters on live television. The establishment parents had trusted was cracking open.</p><p>Vietnam defined young adulthood.

At twenty-one, Saigon fell and helicopters evacuated the last Americans from the embassy roof. At twenty-seven, fifty-two Americans were taken hostage in Iran, and they watched the nightly countdown for 444 days.

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The deal looked like this when Boomers entered the workforce: show up, work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension and a gold watch. That deal actually existed. Companies hired expecting employees would stay for decades. They invested in training because they planned to keep workers. The social contract between employer and employee was real, written in benefits and tenure and mutual obligation.</p><p>This cohort graduated college around 1974, give or take. The timing wasn't ideal—the OPEC oil embargo had just cratered the economy, gas lines stretched around blocks, and stagflation (high unemployment AND high inflation, which economists had thought was impossible) was grinding everyone down. But here's the thing: even in a bad economy, the fundamentals worked. A college degree cost what could be earned in a summer job. Entry-level positions didn't require five years of experience. A single income could support a family.</p><p>If Boomer women entered the workforce, they entered one that was just beginning to crack open. The pill had arrived when this cohort was eight, giving women control over their reproductive futures for the first time. Title IX passed when they were twenty, opening educational doors. Women could have a career that didn't involve typing pools or nursing or teaching. The glass ceiling existed—still exists—but at least they were in the building, and they weren't the first generation through the door, just the first with real numbers.</p><p>Boomers climbed ladders. That's the metaphor this generation used, and it was accurate—they started at the bottom rung and went up, one promotion at a time, usually at the same company. Job-hopping was considered flaky, disloyal, a red flag on a resume. Workers accumulated seniority like savings in a bank. The longer they stayed, the more valuable they became, and companies rewarded that with pensions, corner offices, and eventually retirement parties.</p><p>The rules changed in Boomers' forties and fifties. 'Downsizing' entered the vocabulary. 'Rightsizing.' 'Restructuring.' Pensions converted to 401(k)s, shifting risk from employers to employees. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> Loyalty became a sucker's bet. Boomers were established enough to mostly survive these changes—they'd already made it to middle management, already secured the pension, already bought the house. But they watched younger colleagues get chewed up by a new economy that treated workers as disposable. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The deal Boomers got isn't available anymore. They know that. The question is whether they understand why.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>The generation that came of age when getting a phone call meant someone in the family picked up the receiver and yelled a name. When asking someone on a date meant calling their house and hoping their father didn't answer. When 'going steady' was announced by wearing a class ring on a chain around the neck, and everyone in school knew the status of every relationship by who was wearing whose jewelry.</p><p>Boomers learned courtship through a script their parents had written. First date: movies and milkshakes. Second date: meeting parents. Going steady: letterman jacket, ring, reputation now linked. Pinned, then engaged, then married. There were stages, understood by everyone, and skipping steps had consequences—social ones for boys, life-altering ones for girls.</p><p>The sexual revolution rewrote the rulebook while Boomers were learning to date. The pill became available when this cohort was eight, though it would be years before unmarried women could easily get it. By the time they were in college, 'free love' was the rhetoric on campuses, at protests, in the culture. The reality was more complicated—women still bore the consequences of that freedom, and the double standard didn't disappear just because the rules changed.</p><p>This generation probably married younger than seems possible now. The median marriage age in 1975 was 21 for women, 23 for men. Waiting until 25 made someone a late bloomer. Waiting until 30 made people wonder what was wrong. Marriage was the default, the expected path, the thing people did after college or instead of college. Their grandchildren are delaying marriage into their thirties, and Boomers aren't sure if they're wise or afraid.</p><p>Communication in Boomer youth was expensive and slow. Long-distance calls cost real money—people watched the clock, kept it brief, said what mattered. Love letters were actual letters, written by hand on actual paper, sealed with actual stamps, delivered days later. Breaking up required a conversation, face to face or voice to voice. There was no ghosting when everyone knew everyone, no blocking when people would see each other at church on Sunday.</p><p>Divorce rates doubled during Boomer adulthood, from 2.2 per 1,000 people in 1960 to 5.2 by 1980. No-fault divorce arrived when this cohort was eighteen. Women gained financial independence, credit in their own names, the ability to leave. This generation normalized ending bad marriages instead of enduring them silently. Whether that was liberation or cultural collapse depends on politics and one's own marriage.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Parents survived the Great Depression. They remembered standing in bread lines, watching banks fail, losing everything. <span class=\"pull-quote\">That memory shaped how they handled money—save obsessively, pay cash, never owe anyone anything, keep emergency funds in places banks couldn't touch.</span> Boomers inherited that caution even if they never lived through the same scarcity. The anxiety passed down even when the conditions didn't.</p><p>The numbers tell a story grandchildren find hard to believe. In 1975, when this cohort was 23, the median home price was <span class=\"stat-box\">$39,300</span>. The median household income was <span class=\"stat-box\">$11,800</span>. A house cost about 3.3 years of income. By comparison, in 2024, the median home is <span class=\"stat-box\">$417,000</span> and the median income is <span class=\"stat-box\">$80,000</span>—a ratio of 5.2 to 1. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers bought their first house with a handshake and a 20% down payment they'd saved from a summer job and their first few years of work. Their grandchildren need six-figure incomes and parental help.</span></p><p>This cohort entered adulthood during genuine economic turbulence—the oil embargo when they were twenty-one, stagflation throughout their twenties, interest rates that hit 18% by 1981. It wasn't easy. But here's what they had: affordable college (tuition could be paid with a part-time job), available jobs (unemployment was high but applications got responses), pensions (real ones, defined benefit, the company's problem not theirs), and time. Time is the secret ingredient in compound interest, and Boomers started investing when the Dow was under 1,000.</p><p>Boomer financial journey benefited from time in the market. The basic arithmetic of compound interest rewarded patience—and they had decades to be patient. Houses appreciated while mortgages were paid. Investments grew through bull markets and recovered from bears. Pensions paid out as promised. The system worked the way it was supposed to work, at least for this generation.</p><p>Now Boomer financial concerns have shifted from accumulation to preservation. Healthcare costs that can vaporize savings in months. Long-term care expenses that dwarf most retirement accounts. The question of how long money has to last when longevity keeps extending. Different anxieties than building wealth, but anxieties nonetheless.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's greatest blind spot is the assumption that their experience was universal rather than historically specific. The conditions they navigated—the job markets, housing costs, educational expenses—felt like the natural order of things. Recognizing them as a particular moment requires stepping outside their own story, which is difficult for anyone.</p><p>The terrain looked different when Boomers crossed it. They made reasonable decisions based on the landscape available. The challenge is recognizing that the same decisions made today lead to different destinations—not because people are making them wrong, but because the map has changed. What felt like wisdom can become outdated advice faster than anyone expects.</p><p>This generation has a complicated relationship with race that they don't always examine closely. They lived through the civil rights movement. Many marched, protested, believed in integration. And then they moved to suburbs, opposed busing, voted for policies that perpetuated segregation through property values and school districts rather than explicit laws. The distance between stated values and actual neighborhoods tells a story they'd rather not read.</p><p>Boomers are skeptical of institutions while running most of them. Congress, corporate boards, newsrooms, universities, the Supreme Court—Boomers have dominated American leadership for decades and still do. They complain about 'the establishment' as if the establishment were someone else. The call is coming from inside the house. They are the people they've been warning their children about.</p><p>Climate change is the blind spot that will define Boomer legacy. They knew—the science has been clear since the 1980s, since they were in their thirties and had power and time. This generation chose not to act, chose short-term comfort over long-term survival, chose to leave the bill for their grandchildren. They'll be gone before the worst of it hits. The planet they're leaving behind is measurably worse than the one they inherited, and no amount of recycling or hybrid cars will change that calculus. This is what their grandchildren will remember.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>20s (1972-1982):</strong> This cohort entered adulthood as America's postwar optimism curdled into malaise. Vietnam ended when they were twenty-three. Nixon resigned when they were twenty-two. The oil embargo tanked the economy when they were twenty-one. Disco happened. They got their first real job during stagflation, probably got married (average age: 23 for men, 21 for women), probably had kids by the end of the decade. The revolutionary energy of teenage years channeled into mortgages and car payments. This was the decade of foundations—building the infrastructure of a life while the country struggled to remember who it was.</p><p><strong>30s (1982-1992):</strong> Reagan's America. Morning in America. The economy recovered, and Boomers recovered with it. They were hitting their stride professionally—middle management, maybe upper management, corner offices and expense accounts. The Yuppie was the cultural archetype, and if they lived in a city, they probably owned a BMW or a Volvo and opinions about wine. Kids were in elementary school, then middle school. They bought a bigger house in a better school district. The Cold War ended right as they hit forty—the Berlin Wall fell when they were thirty-seven, the Soviet Union collapsed when they were thirty-nine. The future looked like pure possibility. This was the decade of accumulation.</p><p><strong>40s (1992-2002):</strong> Clinton, the tech boom, irrational exuberance. Boomers were in their peak earning years, and the economy was a rocket ship. 401(k)s doubled, then doubled again. Houses appreciated so fast it felt like free money. Kids were teenagers, which brought its own challenges—AOL, MySpace, music they didn't understand. They started thinking seriously about retirement, maybe bought a vacation property, definitely upgraded the kitchen. Then, at forty-nine, they watched the Twin Towers fall, and the optimism evaporated again. The world got darker. This was the decade of peak prosperity.</p><p><strong>50s (2002-2012):</strong> The War on Terror. Afghanistan, then Iraq, then the forever wars that replaced the Cold War as background anxiety. The housing bubble inflated and then exploded when this cohort was fifty-six. They watched their 401(k) crater—they were close enough to retirement that this wasn't abstract. Kids were adults now, struggling in ways that confused them, burdened by student loans Boomers didn't have, locked out of housing markets Boomers entered easily. They started counting down to retirement while wondering if they could still afford it. This was the decade of uncertainty.</p><p><strong>60s (2012-2022):</strong> Boomers retired, or they didn't, or they tried and then went back because they were bored or broke or both. Friends started dying—not in tragic accidents, but in the ordinary ways that bodies fail. Parents died if they hadn't already. They became the oldest generation in the family, a strange promotion they didn't ask for. The world changed in ways that felt alien—smartphones everywhere, gender more complicated than they were taught, politics unrecognizable, young people who didn't remember the world before the internet. At sixty-eight, a pandemic shut everything down. They spent a year inside, vulnerable, waiting for vaccines that came remarkably fast but still too slow. This was the decade of letting go.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2022+):</strong> This generation is here now. They've witnessed more history than most humans in any era—from Eisenhower to Biden, from no television to virtual reality, from segregation to a Black president and back to whatever this is. Bodies don't work like they used to, but medicine keeps extending what's possible. Friends are dying, faster now. They're making peace with mortality or raging against it, depending on the day. They're telling stories about the world before smartphones to grandchildren who look at them like they're describing science fiction. They're still here, still adapting, still watching a world that keeps changing without asking permission. Not bad for a kid who grew up sticking plastic features into actual potatoes and calling it a toy.</p>"

They were the largest generation in American history until Millennials surpassed them—and they've shaped every institution they've touched through sheer demographic weight.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They were shaped by scarcity—the Depression, rationing, war. Boomers were shaped by abundance—postwar prosperity, suburban expansion, consumer culture. They conformed; Boomers questioned. They trusted institutions that had won a world war; Boomers watched those institutions lie about Vietnam and break into Watergate. They called Boomers spoiled. Boomers called them square. Both were right.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Boomers got pensions and Gen X got 401(k)s. Boomers got affordable college and Gen X got the beginnings of the student loan crisis. Boomers got the good jobs before globalization and automation hollowed out the middle class. Gen X came of age as the economy shifted from manufacturing to services, from stability to precarity. They're called the forgotten generation, sandwiched between Boomers' massive cohort and the Millennials. They're the ones who'll clean up after Boomers.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap tells the story.</span> When Boomers were in their forties, this generation controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age control 7%. Boomers bought houses for two to three years' salary; Millennials are looking at six to eight times theirs, if they can look at all. Boomers had pensions that guaranteed retirement income; Millennials have student debt and 401(k)s that depend on market timing. The math changed. Millennials aren't lazy; they're operating in a different economy.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They might as well be from different planets. Gen Z has never known a world without the internet, without smartphones, without school shooting drills. Climate anxiety is their baseline emotional state. They're more diverse, more tolerant, more skeptical of institutions—including the American Dream itself. They look at Boomers and see the people who knew about climate change for forty years and chose not to act, who accumulated wealth and pulled up ladders, who are still running institutions into the ground. They're not impressed by Boomer Woodstock stories.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers control <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Life expectancy at birth was 68 years for men, 74 for women. Boomers have beaten the odds—modern medicine, better nutrition, declining smoking rates, and luck have given this generation more healthy years than any before. They're redefining what 70 and 80 look like, staying active and engaged and online and opinionated. The question isn't whether they'll live long. It's what kind of world they'll leave behind, and whether their grandchildren will forgive them for it.</p>"
