      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1966-1978</h2><p>The smell of Swanson TV dinners heating in the oven, their foil trays crimped at the corners. The weight of a View-Master pressed against a child's face, clicking through Grand Canyon slides someone bought at a gas station. The satisfying thwack of a Whiffle ball meeting a plastic bat. Childhood in this era had a texture that vanished sometime in the 1980s—wood-paneled, shag-carpeted, and permanently scented with Virginia Slims.</p><p>Star Trek premiered in 1966, beaming its optimistic future into living rooms while Vietnam beamed in something darker every night at six. Children arrived into a country at war with itself—civil rights marches, antiwar protests, cities burning. Parents watched body counts scroll across the Zenith console like sports scores. Kids absorbed the anxiety without understanding it, the way kids absorb everything.</p><p>At three, children watched men walk on the moon. Most don't remember it clearly, but they were there, propped up past bedtime while 600 million people witnessed the impossible. At five, Sesame Street debuted, teaching letters alongside kids from Harlem brownstones. At six, Hot Wheels tracks arrived, spending hours launching orange plastic cars through loop-de-loops that never quite worked right.</p><p>Watergate was background noise at seven. Children watched Nixon's sweaty face fill the screen, watched him resign when they were eight. They didn't understand the details, but they understood the energy—adults were furious, institutions were failing, the people in charge had been lying. That lesson stuck.</p><p>Toys were indestructible: GI Joe with the Kung Fu Grip, Lite-Brite with its tiny pegs that hurt when stepped on, Etch A Sketch that could be shaken clear and started over. Kids ate Tang because the astronauts drank it, Pop-Tarts because they required no parent to prepare, and Jiffy Pop because watching the foil dome expand was half the entertainment. They drank from garden hoses. They rode bikes without helmets. The concept of a playdate didn't exist—children just went outside until the streetlights came on.</p><p>By double digits, children knew how to let themselves into empty houses, make their own snacks, and keep themselves alive until a parent got home. This was normal. Everyone lived the same way. The term 'latchkey kid' hadn't been invented yet, but the pattern was already established.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Gen X Generation</h2><p>Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. The name came from a 1991 Douglas Coupland novel, but the identity was forged in divorce courts and empty houses during the 1970s. There are roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Gen Xers in the US—sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials. The middle child of American generations, overlooked and underestimated, which suits most of them fine.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X was eight when Nixon resigned.</span> Eleven when Elvis died. Thirteen when Three Mile Island melted down and the Iranian hostage crisis began. Fifteen when John Lennon was shot, when Reagan was shot, when AIDS started killing young men nobody would talk about. Twenty when the Challenger exploded—January 28, 1986, the cold morning that became Gen X's defining trauma. A schoolteacher reaching for the stars, seventy-three seconds of hope, then that forking plume of smoke spreading across a Florida sky. Most watched it live, at work or maybe still in a classroom. It was the moment this generation learned that optimism could kill, that systems promising progress could fail spectacularly and publicly. The Berlin Wall would fall three years later, but Challenger was the before-and-after dividing line for Gen X. By adulthood, this cohort had learned that <span class=\"pull-quote\">authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span></p><p>Gen X raised itself. Divorce rates doubled during this generation's childhood—from 26% in the mid-sixties to over 50% by the early eighties. Parents were busy: working, divorcing, 'finding themselves' in ways that didn't include supervising children. Kids came home to empty houses. They made their own dinners—Kraft Mac and Cheese from the blue box, Chef Boyardee straight from the can. They figured things out alone because there was nobody there to figure them out.</p><p>This made Gen X self-reliant in ways that Millennials find baffling and Boomers take credit for. This generation doesn't expect anyone to save them. They don't trust institutions. They've seen too many of them fail. When someone offers easy answers, Gen X's first instinct is skepticism, their second is mockery. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Ironic detachment wasn't apathy; it was armor.</span></p><p>Gen X is the smallest of the major living generations, which means their political power is limited and their cultural influence often ignored. But they've been running things quietly for decades now—building the internet, managing the companies, doing the actual work while Boomers took credit and Millennials got blamed. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X can still entertain themselves without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Batman premiered in 1966—Adam West in gray tights, 'POW!' and 'WHAM!' exploding across the screen in primary colors. The Beach Boys released Pet Sounds that same year. The Beatles released Revolver. Star Trek launched the Enterprise into the future. Pop culture arrived at the exact moment it got weird and never quite recovered.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred: Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! (the groundskeeper was always the culprit), HR Pufnstuf (nobody understood it), Land of the Lost with its terrifying Sleestaks. Bowls of Cap'n Crunch that shredded the roof of mouths while Schoolhouse Rock taught how bills became laws and conjunctions functioned. 'Conjunction Junction' remains singable on command. Everyone this age can.</p><p>At eleven, Star Wars obliterated everything anyone thought movies could be. Lines wrapped around buildings. Action figures—Luke, Han, Chewie, the works—sold out and disappeared by Christmas. At twelve, Animal House arrived and taught that college might actually be fun. At thirteen, Alien taught that space wasn't the hopeful frontier Star Trek promised; it was dark and something out there wanted to eat you.</p><p>Teenage years belonged to MTV, which launched when Gen X was fifteen. The channel actually played music videos then, when 'Video Killed the Radio Star' kicked off a revolution in living rooms. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' wasn't just a song—it was a fourteen-minute horror film watched over and over. Prince's Purple Rain made people feel things they didn't have words for. Madonna taught that provocation was a career path.</p><p>By high school, John Hughes was making movies about Gen X. The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off—these films understood that teenage angst was real, that adults were often clueless, that detention could be transformative. This generation saw themselves on screen for the first time. It felt like someone was finally paying attention.</p><p>Music was physical, ritual, essential. Albums were bought—actual vinyl records, then cassettes—at Sam Goody or Musicland. Mixtapes were made for crushes, agonizing over track order, the handwritten J-card as much a love letter as the songs themselves. Concerts were seen without phones in the air, experienced fully present because there was no other option. The B-sides mattered. Knowing them made a person stand out.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year 1966, computers filled entire rooms and required men in lab coats to operate. ARPANET—the internet's grandfather—wouldn't send its first message until 1969. The technology that defines modern existence was, in 1966, confined to science fiction and defense department budgets. This generation arrived in an analog world and watched it go digital, one bewildering gadget at a time.</p><p>Childhood tech was tactile and temperamental. Televisions with knobs that broke off, requiring pliers to change between three channels. Rotary phones that took forever to dial—one wrong number meant starting over. Record players that had to be balanced with a penny when the needle skipped. Photography meant loading film, dropping it off at the Fotomat, and waiting a week to discover half the pictures were blurry thumbs.</p><p>At eleven, the Apple II arrived—a beige box with green text that seemed magical if anyone was paying attention. Oregon Trail was played on school computers, dying of dysentery with entire wagon parties. At fifteen, the IBM PC launched. At seventeen, the Commodore 64 started showing up in suburban basements. These weren't necessities—they were expensive toys for nerds, conversation pieces that mostly gathered dust. But Gen X was young enough to understand them, old enough to see they mattered.</p><p>The Walkman changed everything when Gen X was thirteen. Suddenly, music was portable. People could create their own soundtrack, walking through the world with Duran Duran or The Clash in their ears, private and present simultaneously. A lot of AA batteries were killed. The orange foam headphones left marks on ears. It was a small price to pay.</p><p>The World Wide Web launched when Gen X was twenty-five. Amazon started selling books when they were twenty-nine. Google arrived when they were thirty-two. The iPod appeared when they were thirty-five. Each innovation landed in adult life, requiring adaptation that hadn't been anticipated. Email was learned in late twenties, texting in thirties, social media in forties. The tools kept changing; the learning never stopped.</p><p>This makes Gen X the last generation with clear memory of the fully analog world. They can read a paper map, use a card catalog, write in cursive, do math without a calculator. They remember when long distance calls cost money, when reaching someone required planning, when boredom was a normal state and not a problem to be solved. Gen X understands technology as a tool because they remember when it didn't exist. They can unplug in ways younger generations can't, because they know what unplugged felt like.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>The year 1966, the Supreme Court established Miranda rights—'you have the right to remain silent' entered the American vocabulary. Medicare and Medicaid launched. The National Organization for Women was founded. The Cultural Revolution swept China. The world was remaking itself, and newborns arrived in the middle of it, absorbing chaos with their formula.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">1968 was the year America came apart</span>—the worst year of the American twentieth century, some historians say. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot on a Memphis balcony in April. Bobby Kennedy was shot in a Los Angeles kitchen in June. The Democratic Convention in Chicago erupted in riots. Cities burned. The country tore itself apart. Gen X doesn't remember any of it, but they grew up in its aftermath, raised by parents who did remember, who carried that trauma into their households.</p><p>Vietnam ended when Gen X was nine. The images remain: helicopters lifting off the embassy roof in Saigon, desperate people clinging to landing gear. America lost a war. The parents' generation had won World War II, saved the world, built the suburbs. Gen X watched them lose, watched the myth of American invincibility die in a jungle on the other side of the planet. The adults seemed as confused as the children.</p><p>At eleven, Jimmy Carter told the nation it was suffering from malaise. At thirteen, the Iran hostage crisis began—<span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days of nightly news countdowns, yellow ribbons on trees, American powerlessness on display. At fifteen, Ronald Reagan was inaugurated, and the hostages came home the same day. Gen X was old enough to notice the timing, young enough to not yet be cynical about it. That would come later.</p><p>At twenty, Challenger's smoke trail spread across the Florida sky—the defining Gen X moment that shaped this generation's permanent skepticism of progress and institutions.</p><p>At twenty-three, the Berlin Wall fell. Gen X watched Germans with sledgehammers tear down the concrete barrier that had defined Cold War geography their entire life. The Soviet Union collapsed two years later. The existential threat of childhood—nuclear annihilation, the mushroom cloud in every nightmare—simply evaporated. Francis Fukuyama declared the end of history. For one brief moment, it seemed like peace might be permanent.</p><p>Gen X was thirty-five on September 11, 2001. Old enough to have a career, a mortgage, maybe kids in elementary school. They watched the towers fall and understood, before anyone said it, that everything was about to change. The forever wars that followed would span their forties and fifties. Their kids would grow up in a country shaped by that morning, under surveillance systems and security theater that didn't exist in the world they were born into.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The job market of 1988 offered entry-level positions that still came with benefits. Pensions existed, though they were beginning to disappear. The social contract between employers and employees still held some meaning. Gen X was the last generation to experience the tail end of that world before it was dismantled.</p><p>The workplace Gen X entered was an artifact. Secretaries typed memos. Filing cabinets held actual files. Desk phones had cords. Rolodexes flipped through business cards organized alphabetically. The fax machine was cutting-edge technology—documents traveling through phone lines felt like magic. Gen X learned to work in an analog office, then watched it transform around them, one technology at a time.</p><p>Gen X built the internet. Not metaphorically—literally. The founders of Google, Amazon, eBay, Yahoo, PayPal, Netflix: Gen X age, more or less. This generation was the right age at the right time—old enough to understand computers as tools rather than toys, young enough to master them, positioned perfectly to ride the digital wave that was about to reshape everything. The people who built the modern tech economy are Gen X high school classmates.</p><p>Gen X also pioneered the 80-hour work week as a lifestyle choice. 'Work hard, play hard' was this generation's mantra, and the play hard part often meant cocaine. Wall Street in the eighties, Silicon Valley in the nineties—Gen X built the culture of performative overwork that Millennials inherited and Gen Z is trying to dismantle.</p><p>The dot-com boom and bust happened when Gen X was in their early thirties. Some got rich on paper, then watched it evaporate. Many watched friends and colleagues live that story. It taught that new economies could fail as spectacularly as old ones, that disruption disrupts in both directions. The 2008 financial crisis hit when Gen X was forty-two—old enough to have built something, young enough to need to keep building.</p><p>By now, Gen X is in leadership positions, or supposed to be. The Boomers above them are finally retiring (slowly, grudgingly, incompletely). The Millennials below them are pushing for changes Gen X isn't sure they understand. Gen X manages in both directions—translating between generations, explaining new technologies to the old guard, explaining old norms to the new. The translation work is exhausting. Gen X has been doing it their entire career.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Gen X learned romance through landlines, not knowing if a parent would answer. They drove to someone's house because there was no other way to reach them. They sat by the phone, literally waiting for it to ring, because portable phones with answering machines were a luxury and caller ID didn't exist.</p><p>Dating, for Gen X, was entirely embodied. This generation met people at parties, through friends, at work, in bars. Personal ads existed in the back of newspapers, but using them was embarrassing—the implication was that one couldn't meet anyone the normal way. Video dating services were punchlines. Gen X looked someone in the eye and asked them to dinner, or wrote their number on a napkin and called three days later because calling sooner seemed desperate.</p><p>Gen X got married later than their parents—the median age crept up through the eighties and nineties as this generation invented the extended adolescence that Millennials would later be mocked for. Parents married at twenty-two; Gen X married at twenty-seven or thirty or maybe not at all. The sexual revolution had happened. The urgency to lock things down had diminished. Gen X had options, and they used them.</p><p>Gen X also had the highest divorce rate in American history. This generation watched their parents' marriages dissolve—that doubling of divorce rates happened during their childhood—and many repeated the pattern. First marriages failed. But Gen X learned. Second marriages had better odds. This generation approached relationships with fewer illusions than the generations before them. They expected difficulty because they'd seen it up close.</p><p>Communication has migrated through more platforms than can be counted. Gen X started with landlines and letters, graduated to email in their late twenties, discovered texting in their thirties, adopted social media in their forties. Each transition required learning a new grammar, a new etiquette, a new way of maintaining connections. Gen X is fluent in all of them now, more or less, but they remember when reaching someone required effort, when distance meant something, when missing someone was an actual physical ache rather than a notification that hadn't arrived.</p><p>Gen X friendships are smaller and deeper than younger generations'. This generation doesn't have 500 connections; they have five close friends they've known for thirty years. Gen X is suspicious of performative friendship, of birthday posts that substitute for actual presence. They know what real support looks like because they've needed it, provided it, watched the difference between people who show up and people who just click 'like.'</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>The economic landscape for those entering adulthood in 1988 included gas lines snaking around blocks during the oil embargo. Children were eight or nine, sitting in the back of parents' station wagons, waiting for hours to fill the tank. Inflation was double digits. Stagflation wasn't a vocabulary word yet, but people were living through it. The economy could fail—this was the first lesson, learned early, never forgotten.</p><p>Gen X bought their first houses when houses were still buyable. The median home price when Gen X was thirty was roughly three times the median income. (For Millennials at thirty, it's six times.) Gen X caught the tail end of affordable real estate, rode the appreciation wave up through the nineties and two-thousands, and found themselves asset-rich by accident. Houses made more money than salaries some years. This wasn't virtue; it was timing.</p><p>The pension-to-401(k) transition happened during Gen X's career. Some started work with a defined benefit plan, watched it converted to a defined contribution plan, learned to manage their own retirement investments without anyone teaching them how. Parents had pensions. Kids have student debt. Gen X is in between, as always—better off than those who came after, worse off than those who came before.</p><p>Gen X has survived multiple recessions as adults: 1990-91, 2001, 2008, 2020. Each time, they watched the economy contract, watched friends lose jobs, watched portfolios collapse. Each time, they learned the same lesson: security is an illusion, the floor can drop out. Gen X's financial worldview is cautiously pessimistic—things might get better, but they're planning for worse.</p><p>The 2008 crisis hit when Gen X was forty-two, probably their peak earning years. They'd built equity, established credit, accumulated the cushion that younger workers didn't have. They survived. But they watched Millennials—many of them just entering the workforce—get crushed by a disaster they didn't cause. Some part of Gen X knows they got lucky. Some part still believes it was hard work. Both things are true.</p><p>Gen X is financially comfortable compared to younger generations, but haunted by the question of 'enough.' Will Social Security exist when they're seventy? Will their 401(k) last thirty years? Will healthcare costs bankrupt them before they die? The math doesn't always work out. The anxiety never quite goes away. Gen X has just learned to function around it.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Gen X's biggest weakness is mistaking cynicism for intelligence. This generation has seen so many systems fail that they've stopped believing systems can work. Watergate, Iran-Contra, Monica Lewinsky, WMDs in Iraq—the lies piled up until skepticism became the default setting. But cynicism isn't wisdom. Sometimes institutions function. Sometimes engagement matters. Sometimes the cynical response is just laziness dressed up as sophistication.</p><p>Gen X is so proud of self-reliance that they've forgotten how to ask for help. The latchkey years made this generation independent by necessity, and they converted that necessity into identity. Gen X handles things alone. They don't complain. They certainly don't go to therapy—that was stigmatized when they were young, and some of that stigma stuck. Gen X suffers in silence and calls it strength. It isn't. It's just suffering.</p><p>Gen X's ironic detachment protected them in the nineties but limits them now. This generation can't just like things; they have to like them ironically, with air quotes, with distance. Sincerity feels dangerous because sincerity makes them vulnerable. But some things deserve genuine commitment. Some fights require earnest participation. Gen X's refusal to take anything seriously made them hard to manipulate—but also hard to mobilize.</p><p>Gen X dismisses younger generations the way Boomers dismissed them. This generation rolls their eyes at Millennials' participation trophies (that Boomers gave them). They mock Gen Z's social media fluency (built on platforms Gen X created). Gen X has become the dismissive adults they resented as teenagers, offering the same lectures about toughness and work ethic that they found irrelevant when they received them. The cycle continues.</p><p>Gen X benefited from timing they didn't earn. This generation bought houses before they were unaffordable. They started careers before the ladder was pulled up. They accumulated wealth during a historical window that has since closed. Gen X worked hard—absolutely—but so did the generations after them. The difference isn't effort; it's era. Acknowledging luck alongside labor is difficult when identity is built on having earned everything independently. But the luck was real.</p><p>Gen X has stopped noticing how much the world has changed since they formed their assumptions about it. The economy they navigated in their twenties no longer exists. The job market they understood has transformed. The paths that worked for Gen X are closed to those who came after. Giving advice based on an obsolete map isn't helpful, but Gen X does it anyway, because the map worked for them and accepting that it doesn't work anymore requires admitting the world has left them behind in certain ways.</p>"

    "life_roadmap": {
      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>20s (1986-1996):</strong> Gen X graduated into the Reagan economy—recovering from recession, building toward boom. Entry-level jobs existed. Benefits existed. The implicit promise that hard work led somewhere still held. Careers were built in analog offices that would transform around them. Some got married, got divorced, learned early that relationships require more than love. The Berlin Wall fell when Gen X was twenty-three. The Soviet Union collapsed when they were twenty-five. The Cold War that had defined their entire childhood ended, and nobody quite knew what came next. For a moment, everything seemed possible.</p><p><strong>30s (1996-2006):</strong> The dot-com boom rewarded Gen X's tech fluency. This generation rode the wave up, maybe crashed when it burst. They bought houses, had kids, built the adult lives they'd been told to want. September 11th hit when Gen X was thirty-five—old enough to have established stability, young enough for everything to shift beneath it. They had to explain terrorism to elementary schoolers while processing their own shock. The forever wars began. The surveillance state expanded. The optimism of the nineties curdled into something grimmer.</p><p><strong>40s (2006-2016):</strong> The 2008 financial crisis arrived when Gen X was forty-two. They'd built enough equity to survive, but they watched the younger workers around them get devastated. Kids were teenagers, demanding attention, pushing boundaries, costing money. Parents were aging, needing more care than they'd admit. Gen X was sandwiched—the responsible generation, managing up and down simultaneously. Peak earning years, peak stress years, peak everything-at-once years.</p><p><strong>50s (2016-2026):</strong> Gen X is here now, in the thick of this decade. Trump, COVID, social fracturing—the hits keep coming. Kids are adults, more or less, struggling in an economy that doesn't reward their efforts the way it rewarded Gen X's. Parents need Gen X more. Retirement is visible on the horizon but unclear in the details. Will they have enough? Will their health hold? Will the systems they're counting on still exist? Gen X is senior enough at work to have power, tired enough to wonder why they wanted it.</p><p><strong>60s (2026-2036):</strong> Retirement age, theoretically. Some Gen Xers will retire comfortably on accumulated assets. Some will keep working because the math never worked out. Health will dictate more than they'd like. The world will be run by people who don't remember a pre-digital existence. Grandchildren will find rotary phones and paper maps fascinating in the way Gen X found their grandparents' stories of the Depression fascinating—historical artifacts from an unimaginable past.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2036+):</strong> Gen X will be the keepers of analog memory—the ones who remember when phones had cords, when music was vinyl, when reaching someone required effort. Grandchildren will interview them for school projects about 'life before the internet.' Gen X will tell them about Watergate, about the Challenger, about watching the Berlin Wall fall. They won't fully believe it. It will sound like science fiction. And Gen X will realize that they've become the same kind of elder their grandparents were: survivors of a vanished world, bearers of stories nobody else remembers.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>Roughly 3.6 million Americans were born in 1966—part of the 65 million who make up Generation X. Gen X is the smallest of the major living generations, sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials. The middle child of American demographics, overlooked in every conversation about generational conflict.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> Boomers inherited post-war prosperity and believed they'd earned it. Gen X inherited Watergate and learned to trust nothing. Boomers had Woodstock; Gen X had disco's funeral and punk's snarl. Boomers got pensions; Gen X got 401(k)s and a book about cheese moving. Boomers bought houses for two years' salary; Gen X bought them for three, which still makes Gen X luckier than everyone who came after. Boomers had numbers, political power, cultural dominance. Gen X had irony and the ability to program a VCR.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> Millennials were raised by helicopter parents; Gen X was raised by no one. Millennials believe institutions can work if fixed; Gen X believes institutions mostly fail. Millennials want work-life balance; Gen X wants to finish the job and go home. Millennials were told they were special their whole childhoods; Gen X was told to fend for themselves. Millennials are optimistic despite evidence; Gen X is pessimistic because of it. The surprise is that they're more alike than different—both generations got economically shafted, just at different life stages.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Gen Z has never known a world without internet; Gen X has never fully forgotten the world before it. Gen Z communicates in images and videos; Gen X still writes in complete sentences. Gen Z expects institutions to fail and is building alternatives; Gen X expected institutions to fail and just withdrew. Gen Z is digital natives; Gen X is digital immigrants who speak the language fluently but with an accent. Gen Z is anxious in ways that feel familiar—Gen X sees their own childhood isolation reflected in Gen Z's screen-mediated loneliness.</p><p>Gen X's life expectancy hovers around 78-80 years, similar to recent generations. Health outcomes vary by economic status and access to care. The self-reliance that defined Gen X also isolated some when things went wrong. This generation doesn't ask for help easily. They don't show weakness readily. Sometimes that costs them.</p><p>Financially, Gen X is the middle child again: better off than Millennials and Gen Z, worse off than Boomers. Gen X caught the tail end of affordable housing, pensions, and upward mobility. They built wealth during a historical window that has since closed. Their children can't replicate Gen X's path, and some part of Gen X knows it's not their fault.</p><p>What sets Gen X apart is range. This generation has lived across more technological transitions than any generation in history—typewriters to smartphones, letters to TikTok, three channels to infinite streaming. Gen X is analog in origin, digital by necessity, fluent in both worlds. They're the translators, the explainers, the ones who remember how things used to work while operating the systems that replaced them. It's exhausting. It's also their superpower.</p>"
