      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1955-1967</h2><p>Children born in 1955 arrived at the peak of the baby boom — the single highest year for births in the entire eighteen-year surge. Hospitals were practiced at the volume by now, and the suburbs had matured from raw developments into established neighborhoods with shade trees, worn paths through backyards, and the settled routines of communities that had been in place for nearly a decade. These children were born not into the experiment of postwar suburbia but into its full flowering, inheriting a world their slightly older siblings had helped break in.</p><p>The domestic landscape was comfortable and deeply gendered. Their mothers ran households with an efficiency that looked effortless and was anything but — managing children, meals, social obligations, volunteer commitments, and the emotional life of the family, all without the language to describe the labor or the standing to negotiate its terms. Their fathers were defined almost entirely by their work, present on evenings and weekends as authority figures whose approval mattered and whose inner lives remained largely opaque. The family dinner was sacrosanct. Church was expected. Arguments happened behind closed doors. The surface was always smooth.</p><p>At two, Sputnik rattled the country, and though these children were too young to understand the crisis, they grew up inside its consequences. Their elementary school years were shaped by the post-Sputnik educational push — new emphasis on science and math, a sense that academic achievement was tied to national survival. Duck-and-cover drills continued, the weekly rehearsal for a catastrophe that adults hoped would never come but clearly feared might. The drills taught compliance more than survival; the real lesson was that the orderly world of the classroom existed within a larger and more dangerous one.</p><p>At eight, the president was shot. These children were in third grade — old enough to understand that something terrible had happened, young enough that the event imprinted more as emotion than analysis. The teachers cried. School sent them home. The television stayed on for days. The experience was their first encounter with collective grief, and it arrived with a force that permanently altered their understanding of the world's reliability. The confident, forward-looking America of their earliest years suddenly seemed fragile.</p><p>The years that followed the assassination brought the civil rights struggle and the Vietnam War into their living rooms with increasing intensity. At ten, Watts burned. At twelve, the Summer of Love promised a different kind of America. These children spent the final years of their childhood watching the country they'd been raised in transform into something their parents barely recognized — more turbulent, more honest, more divided, and less certain about what it was becoming. The transition from childhood to adolescence coincided almost exactly with the transition from one American era to another.</p><p>What they carry from those years is a childhood split neatly in two: the first half stable, suburban, and confident in the future; the second half marked by assassination, protest, and the dawning awareness that the adult world was considerably more complicated and more broken than anyone had let on. They are, in a sense, the last children of the postwar consensus and the first children of the upheaval that followed it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The term started as demography and became an identity—and eventually, an accusation. This cohort is part of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans born between 1946 and 1964, the post-war population explosion that reshaped everything from school construction to rock and roll to the size of the national debt.</p><p>This cohort was nine when the Beatles landed at JFK Airport, February 1964. They watched it on television—the screaming girls, the mop tops, Ed Sullivan struggling to maintain order. Before that moment, they listened to their parents' music. After it, they had their own. The generational divide wasn't invented that day, but it became audible.</p><p>This cohort spans eighteen years within the Boomer generation, which means the oldest Boomers were already fighting in Vietnam when this cohort was learning to drive. The generation isn't monolithic. Early Boomers remember Korea and Eisenhower. This cohort remembers Kennedy's assassination and the Summer of Love. Late Boomers barely remember Vietnam at all. The experiences diverge, even if the label sticks.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">The defining sequence came rapid-fire: JFK shot when this cohort was eight. Malcolm X when they were nine. MLK and RFK when they were thirteen—two assassinations in two months, 1968.</span> Vietnam on the evening news every night. Watergate hearings when they were eighteen. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This generation grew up believing in American institutions, then watched them lie, fail, and kill. Trust became something they verified.</span> <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p><p>Boomers get blamed for everything now: the housing crisis, climate change, the national debt, helicopter parenting, avocado toast economics. Some criticism is fair—this generation did vote for policies that benefited themselves at others' expense. But individuals aren't generations. This cohort didn't personally cause the housing crisis any more than a single Millennial personally killed department stores.</p><p>What's undeniable: this cohort came of age during unprecedented prosperity and rode that wave for decades. Houses were affordable. Wages kept pace with productivity. A summer job could pay for a year of college. The American Dream wasn't a slogan—it was a reasonable expectation. That experience shaped assumptions that don't match the world they're leaving behind.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Bill Haley's 'Rock Around the Clock' hit number one the year this cohort was born. Chuck Berry released 'Maybellene.' Little Richard recorded 'Tutti Frutti.' Elvis Presley signed with RCA Records and started his climb. This cohort arrived just as rock and roll exploded—the soundtrack of childhood was being invented in real time.</p><p>At two, children were too young to care, but older cousins were going crazy over Elvis on Ed Sullivan (September 1956, shot from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous). By five, children knew the words to 'Hound Dog' even if they didn't understand them. By seven, they had opinions about whether Ricky Nelson or Fabian was better. The answer was always Elvis.</p><p>Television was the babysitter, the teacher, the window to the world. Children grew up on The Mickey Mouse Club (Annette was every boy's first crush), Captain Kangaroo, Howdy Doody reruns. At six, The Flintstones premiered—a cartoon in prime time, for adults, that children watched anyway. The Twilight Zone gave nightmares. Leave It to Beaver made children wonder why their family wasn't that calm.</p><p>At nine, the Beatles arrived. February 9, 1964, Ed Sullivan Theater. Seventy-three million people watched. This cohort was one of them. The screaming started and didn't stop for a decade. Within months, children had Beatles cards, Beatles wigs, Beatles everything. Parents thought it was noise. They were wrong.</p><p>Teenage years tracked the sixties' acceleration. At ten: Motown—the Supremes, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye. At eleven: Dylan went electric and folk purists lost their minds. At twelve: 'Good Vibrations,' 'Paint It Black,' 'These Boots Are Made for Walkin'.' At thirteen: Sgt. Pepper, the Summer of Love, Monterey Pop. At fourteen: Woodstock. This cohort was too young to go, but they knew it mattered. They might have had the album.</p><p>Movies followed the same arc. Children grew up on Disney—Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians, Mary Poppins when they were nine. But by high school, the Hays Code was dead and Hollywood was making Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Graduate (1967), Easy Rider (1969). Violence, sex, nihilism, ambiguity—the movies grew up when this cohort did. At fifteen, they saw Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. At seventeen, The Godfather. Parents' cinema was dead. Theirs was just beginning.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year this cohort was born, Jonas Salk's polio vaccine was declared safe and effective. Parents wept with relief—they remembered summers of closed swimming pools, iron lungs, children in braces. This generation would never know that fear. Technology meant safety. Technology meant progress. Technology meant the future would be better than the past.</p><p>Childhood technology was analog, mechanical, built to last. The rotary phone on the wall—seven digits, party lines in rural areas, long-distance calls saved for emergencies because they cost money. The television that took thirty seconds to warm up, vacuum tubes glowing orange before the picture appeared. Three channels, four if families were lucky, snow and static if the antenna wasn't adjusted right.</p><p>At two, Sputnik launched and America panicked. This cohort doesn't remember it, but they lived its consequences: science education became a national priority, space became the frontier, and by the time they were in elementary school, astronauts were heroes. Children collected trading cards with their faces. They built model rockets. They watched every launch.</p><p>At fourteen, this cohort watched humans walk on the moon. July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong's grainy boot touching lunar dust. 'One small step.' They were glued to the television with 600 million other people—the largest audience in human history. For one night, the future arrived exactly as promised. Space colonies and flying cars couldn't be far behind. (They were.)</p><p>At seventeen, the first pocket calculator appeared—the HP-35, costing $395, three weeks' salary for many workers. This cohort had done math with slide rules. Now they didn't have to. At twenty-two, the Apple II launched. At twenty-six, the IBM PC. This generation watched offices transform from typewriters and carbon paper to glowing screens. 'Word processing' sounded like a factory. They adapted, because the alternative was obsolescence.</p><p>At forty, the internet arrived. This generation learned email (why would I need this?), then the World Wide Web (what's a browser?), then eventually, grudgingly, smartphones and social media. Boomers have adapted to more technological change than any generation in history—from party lines to FaceTime, from vinyl records to streaming, from handwritten letters to texts. The learning never stopped. Neither did the suspicion that this wasn't all progress.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At eight, Kennedy was assassinated—November 22, 1963. Where were Boomers born in 1955 when they heard?</span> Historically, what followed was a decade of escalation: Vietnam, civil rights marches turning violent, cities burning, two more assassinations in 1968. The optimism of early childhood gave way to turbulence that would define adolescence.</p><p>This cohort was nine during Freedom Summer, 1964—three civil rights workers murdered in Mississippi, their bodies found in an earthen dam. They were ten when John Lewis led marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and state troopers beat them bloody on national television. Bloody Sunday. They watched it at dinner. The Civil Rights Movement wasn't history class. It was the evening news, every night, while families ate.</p><p>At eleven, this cohort watched Watts burn—six days of riots in Los Angeles, thirty-four dead. At twelve, Newark and Detroit. Cities on fire became a recurring image. Parents whispered about 'changing neighborhoods' and 'crime.' This generation was learning, slowly, that America had problems nobody on Leave It to Beaver mentioned.</p><p>At thirteen, 1968 happened. April 4: Martin Luther King Jr. assassinated in Memphis. Cities exploded again. June 5: Robert Kennedy shot in Los Angeles, died the next day. August: the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, police beating protesters while the whole world watched. This cohort was old enough to understand that the country was cracking. They weren't old enough to know if it could be fixed.</p><p>At fourteen, this cohort watched the moon landing—but also Woodstock, Altamont, the Manson murders, My Lai. The same year: hope and horror, achievement and atrocity. At fifteen, Kent State: National Guard shooting college students. At seventeen, Watergate broke. At nineteen, Nixon resigned. The president was a crook. The system caught him—eventually. The lesson was ambiguous.</p><p>At twenty, Saigon fell. April 30, 1975. Helicopters lifting off embassy rooftops, desperate crowds, the end of a war that defined adolescence. This cohort knew people who went to Vietnam. They might know people who didn't come back. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,000</span> American names on that wall in Washington. At thirty-four, the Berlin Wall came down. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At fifty-three, the financial system collapsed.

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The class of 1973 entered a labor market during the OPEC oil embargo. The class of 1977 entered during stagflation. Unemployment above 7%, inflation above 6%, interest rates climbing toward double digits. The economic landscape for those entering adulthood in the mid-1970s was challenging, but the fundamentals still functioned. A college degree cost what could be earned in a summer job. Entry-level positions existed. A single income could support a family.</p><p>The career ladder that previous generations climbed—entry-level to corner office at one company, forty years, pension, gold watch—was beginning to shift. Workers might have started at one company expecting lifetime employment. By the 1980s, 'restructuring' became common. Layoffs weren't failures anymore; they were 'strategic realignment.'</p><p>This generation adapted. The Reagan boom rewarded those who could pivot. They learned to network before anyone called it that. They switched companies when loyalty wasn't reciprocated. They acquired new skills—computing, spreadsheets, eventually email—because the alternative was obsolescence. By 1990, this cohort had survived enough downturns to recognize the pattern: panic, layoffs, recovery, repeat.</p><p>The workplace this generation entered had three-martini lunches and secretarial pools. The workplace they retired from had standing desks and Slack channels. In between: cubicles (Action Office II, 1968, became soul-crushing by 1988), open floor plans (supposed to encourage collaboration, actually encouraged distraction), remote work (pandemic necessity that became permanent). This generation sat through every management fad: Quality Circles, Six Sigma, Agile, Holacracy. They all promised transformation. They all meant more meetings.</p><p>Compensation tells a complicated story. White men who stayed employed and invested in the stock market accumulated significant wealth. Women spent their careers earning 60 cents (1970s) to 82 cents (2020s) on the dollar. Black workers faced even wider wealth gaps—structural barriers that existed when this cohort entered the workforce still exist now, just better disguised.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> Retirement arrived differently than expected. The pension that was promised became a 401(k) managed independently. Social Security helps but doesn't cover everything. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Some peers retired at 62 and play golf. Some are working at 70 because they have to. The average hides enormous variation.</span> This generation accumulated more wealth than any before it, but 'this generation' is an aggregate that obscures who won and who lost.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>The generation that came of age when asking someone out meant calling their house, talking to their father first, and hoping nobody was listening on the extension. When a date meant picking someone up at the door, meeting the parents, having a plan for the evening that didn't involve staring at screens. When the only way to stay in touch was letters, phone calls that cost money, and actually showing up.</p><p>This cohort came of age during the sexual revolution. The birth control pill was FDA-approved in 1960, but it took years to become widely available. By the time they were dating seriously—late teens, early twenties—the rules had changed. Cohabitation before marriage went from scandal to common. Divorce lost most of its stigma. Parents' courtship rituals (chaperoned dates, engagement within months, virgin brides) seemed quaint, restrictive, maybe hypocritical.</p><p>The average age at first marriage when this cohort was born was 22 for men, 20 for women. By the time they married—probably late 1970s or early 1980s—it had crept up a few years. Still young by today's standards. Some of those marriages lasted. Many didn't. The divorce rate peaked around 1980, when this cohort was twenty-five. Nearly half of marriages from this era ended in divorce. The expectations placed on marriage in this generation were contradictory and often impossible.</p><p>Blended families became normal. Children might have step-siblings, half-siblings, multiple sets of grandparents. Holiday logistics became complex. The nuclear family of childhood TV shows—Mom, Dad, 2.3 kids, dog—turned out to be a snapshot, not a template. Families got messier. Arguably, they got more honest.</p><p>Communication technology reshaped relationships across this generation's lifetime. The wall phone with the long cord stretched into the closet for privacy. The answering machine that let people screen calls. Call waiting, voicemail, email, texting, FaceTime. Each upgrade required learning. This generation adapted because their kids and grandkids expected it. They can text now. They might even use emojis. The eye-roll one, probably, when grandchildren send too many.</p><p>The oldest friendships span sixty years—people who remember when this cohort had hair, when they were thin, when they made mistakes they'd rather forget. Some friendships survived distance, marriage, divorce, death. Some faded without drama. Geography used to determine friendship: people were close to whoever lived nearby. Now relationships can be maintained across any distance, theoretically. In practice, it takes effort not everyone makes.</p>"

When this cohort turned twenty-one in 1976, the median home price was <span class=\"stat-box\">$44,200</span>—about 2.8 times the median household income. When Millennials turned twenty-one, it was six times. Same ratio for college tuition, adjusted for inflation: four years at a public university cost about <span class=\"stat-box\">$2,000</span> in 1975; it costs <span class=\"stat-box\">$45,000</span> now. <span class=\"hero-callout\">These aren't arguments. They're just math.</span></p><p>This cohort entered adulthood during stagflation—the 1970s economy that wasn't supposed to be possible. Unemployment and inflation simultaneously high. Gas lines. Malaise. The economic orthodoxy of parents' generation failed, and this generation learned early that experts could be wrong, that systems could break, that the rules could change without notice.</p><p>But then the rules changed in this generation's favor. The Reagan boom of the 1980s. The Clinton expansion of the 1990s. If someone bought a house in 1980 for $70,000, it's worth $400,000 now, and they didn't have to do anything except make mortgage payments. If someone invested in the S&P 500 starting in 1982, they've averaged 10% annual returns for forty years. Time in the market matters more than timing the market—and this generation had the time.</p><p>Wealth accumulated through time in the market—decades of consistent investment during periods when markets generally rewarded patience. Houses appreciated. Portfolios grew through bull markets and recovered from bears. The arithmetic of compound interest, applied over forty years, produced results that felt earned because they required discipline, even if timing played its part.</p><p>Financial anxieties are real but different now. Healthcare costs can bankrupt retirees—one serious illness, one nursing home stay, can vaporize a lifetime of savings. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This generation might outlive their money; longevity is a gift and a threat.</span> Social Security helps but wasn't designed for thirty-year retirements. The pension earned might have been converted to a 401(k) managed independently, for better or worse.</p><p>Current financial reality involves preservation more than accumulation. Healthcare costs that can consume savings rapidly. Long-term care expenses that exceed most planning estimates. The question of how much to leave versus how much to spend while it can still be enjoyed. Money flows in multiple directions now—supporting children, grandchildren—and the arithmetic grows more complex each year.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This cohort's biggest blind spot is recognizing when advice becomes historical rather than practical. The strategies that worked for them were sound within their context. Contexts change. The instinct to share what worked is generous; the assumption that it still applies can be limiting.</p><p>This generation's experience was real and valid. So were the conditions that shaped it. Separating personal effort from historical circumstance requires stepping outside one's own story—seeing it as one path through a particular landscape, not the universal route everyone should follow. That's difficult. It's also what wisdom looks like.</p><p>This generation tends to confuse correlation with causation. They worked hard and succeeded, so hard work causes success. But they also entered the workforce during a thirty-year economic expansion, bought houses before prices tripled, got degrees before they required decades of debt. The correlation between effort and reward was real. It was also historically specific. The causation might have been timing as much as virtue.</p><p>There's a reluctance to examine how much government policy helped. The GI Bill that sent parents to college and bought their houses. The mortgage interest deduction that subsidized home purchases. The employer-provided healthcare and pensions that meant benefits weren't a problem to solve. These weren't handouts—they were infrastructure. But infrastructure looks like personal achievement when standing on it.</p><p>Technology is another blind spot. This generation adapted to every change—computers, internet, smartphones—but adaptation isn't the same as understanding. The internet isn't just a faster library. Social media isn't just letters typed instead of written. The attention economy, the algorithm, the way information now works—these are structural changes, not just new tools. The instinct to dismiss what isn't fully understood is human. It's also limiting.</p><p>The hardest blind spot to see is the assumption that this generation's experience is universal. The Boomer story—work hard, buy house, retire comfortably—was never universal, even within this generation. It was more available to white men than to anyone else. It was more available in some decades than others. Survivorship bias means the success stories write the history; the people for whom it didn't work aren't giving TED talks about hustle.</p>"

Early adulthood was stagflation, gas lines, disco, and malaise. The economy didn't welcome them; they survived it. Most got married in this decade—average age at first marriage was still under 25. Many bought their first house, probably with an interest rate over 10%. Reagan's 'Morning in America' arrived in 1984. For some, it actually felt like morning.</p><p><strong>30s (1985-1995):</strong> The building decade. The economy expanded. Wall Street boomed. The Cold War ended without nuclear war, which seemed less inevitable than they'd been raised to believe. This cohort advanced in careers, accumulated equity, started families if they hadn't already. Their kids were born into a world of VCRs, cable TV, and Nintendo. The Berlin Wall fell when this cohort was thirty-four. History was supposedly over. It wasn't.</p><p><strong>40s (1995-2005):</strong> Peak earning years. Mortgages were getting manageable. 401(k)s were growing. The Clinton economy delivered low unemployment and budget surpluses. The internet arrived; this generation learned email. The dot-com boom made paper millionaires. The dot-com crash unmade them. Then September 11, 2001—this cohort was forty-six, probably at work, watching towers fall on a conference room TV. The world split into before and after, again.</p><p><strong>50s (2005-2015):</strong> This cohort turned fifty as housing prices peaked and the system prepared to collapse. The 2008 financial crisis hit when they were fifty-three—401(k)s lost a third of their value, houses might have gone underwater, younger colleagues got laid off. The recovery was slow. Their kids graduated into the worst job market since the Depression. This generation helped them more than they'd planned. Parents aged, needing care. Sandwich generation: supporting both directions.</p><p><strong>60s (2015-2025):</strong> Retirement arrived, or didn't, depending on circumstances. Some left work at 62 with pensions and portfolios intact. Some couldn't afford to stop. COVID hit when this cohort was sixty-five—highest risk category, locked in their houses, watching the world through screens. Grandchildren they couldn't hug. Vacations they couldn't take. The golden years looked different than the brochure. Still: they're here. Many aren't.</p><p><strong>70s and beyond (2025+):</strong> This generation is seventy now, living longer than their parents or grandparents expected. Longevity is a gift and a problem. Healthcare costs can consume savings in months. Nursing homes cost more than most people saved. The systems designed to support them—Social Security, Medicare—are strained and politically contested. Final decades depend partly on choices, partly on luck, partly on whether younger generations decide to fund the programs this generation is counting on.

This cohort is part of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers who've been the dominant demographic force in America for most of their adult life. Politicians courted their vote. Marketers targeted their wallet. The culture was built around their preferences because there were so many of them. That dominance is ending now, and it's disorienting.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> Parents' cohort. They grew up during the Depression and fought in World War II or Korea. They trusted institutions because institutions had delivered: victory, prosperity, progress. This cohort learned to question those same institutions because they watched them lie about Vietnam, spy on citizens, and break laws from the Oval Office. They stayed married; this cohort got divorced at historic rates. They saved; this cohort spent. They were reticent; this cohort went to therapy. Different times produced different people.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The forgotten middle children. They grew up in Boomer shadow, latchkey kids while Boomers were at work, watching Boomers take the good jobs and houses before they could compete. They're more cynical than Boomers—Watergate babies, raised on divorce, skeptical of optimism. They're also, quietly, the ones running most companies and institutions now while Boomers argue with Millennials online. They don't complain because complaining isn't their style. It doesn't mean they've forgiven Boomers.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap captures the difference.</span> When Boomers were in their forties, this generation controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age control 7%. Boomers bought houses for two to three years' salary. Millennials are looking at six to eight times theirs—if they can buy at all. Boomers had pensions and employer healthcare. Millennials have student debt and 401(k)s they manage themselves. The economy Boomers navigated and the economy Millennials face are fundamentally different.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Boomers' grandchildren's generation. They've never known a world without the internet, without school shooting drills, without climate anxiety. They don't remember 9/11. They don't remember life before smartphones. Boomer childhood optimism—the sense that things generally improve—is incomprehensible to them. Their digital fluency is incomprehensible to Boomers. The gap between these generations is wider than any gap before.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers control <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Life expectancy at birth was about 69 years. Boomers have exceeded that. Medical advances extended their runway; the question now is quality, not just quantity. They're living longer than their parents, but chronic disease, cognitive decline, and the sheer expense of aging complicate the picture. Longevity is a gift. It's also, sometimes, a burden. Nobody advertised that part.</p>"
