      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1955-1967</h2><p>The smell of cap gun smoke on summer evenings. The weight of a Davy Crockett coonskin cap on your head. The satisfying thwack of a Slinky walking down the stairs. Your childhood had a texture—chrome, Formica, and the crackle of a black-and-white TV warming up in the living room.</p><p>Disneyland opened the year you were born, July 17, 1955. You probably didn't make it there until you were six or seven, but the magic was everywhere anyway—Mousketeer ears, Mickey Mouse Club after school, Annette Funicello's face on everything. At three, you were singing 'M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E' whether you understood it or not.</p><p>Your toys were simple and indestructible. Lincoln Logs and Erector Sets. Tonka trucks built like actual trucks. Betsy Wetsy dolls that needed real diapers. Mr. Potato Head—the original version where you stuck plastic parts into an actual potato. Play-Doh appeared when you were one, and the smell still takes you back instantly. At four, you got your first Hula Hoop during the craze of 1958, along with every other kid in America.</p><p>Friday nights meant TV dinners on TV trays—Swanson's aluminum compartments of turkey, cornbread stuffing, and peas that had never seen a fresh vegetable. The television warmed up slowly, tubes glowing orange, and then: Gunsmoke. Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Your parents watched Lawrence Welk; you waited for cartoons that only came on Saturday mornings. Mighty Mouse, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw—you had to be up early or you missed them entirely.</p><p>At five, you started school in a classroom with wooden desks bolted to the floor, inkwells nobody used anymore, and a teacher who could still paddle you. You learned to read with Dick and Jane: 'See Spot run.' You practiced cursive until your hand cramped. You recited the Pledge of Allegiance every morning and ducked under your desk during atomic bomb drills, as if that would help.</p><p>At eight, you were in third grade when President Kennedy was shot. November 22, 1963. You probably heard it over the school intercom—the principal's voice shaking. Teachers cried. School let out early. For the next four days, your family sat in front of the television watching everything: the casket, Jackie's black veil, John-John's salute. You learned that the world could break without warning, and that adults didn't always have answers.</p>"

    "generational_identity": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The term started as demography and became an identity—and eventually, an accusation. You're part of the 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964, the post-war population explosion that reshaped everything from school construction to rock and roll to the size of the national debt.</p><p>You were nine when the Beatles landed at JFK Airport, February 1964. You watched it on television—the screaming girls, the mop tops, Ed Sullivan struggling to maintain order. Before that moment, you listened to your parents' music. After it, you had your own. The generational divide wasn't invented that day, but it became audible.</p><p>Your cohort spans eighteen years, which means the oldest Boomers were already fighting in Vietnam when you were learning to drive. The generation isn't monolithic. Early Boomers remember Korea and Eisenhower. You remember Kennedy's assassination and the Summer of Love. Late Boomers barely remember Vietnam at all. The experiences diverge, even if the label sticks.</p><p>The defining sequence came rapid-fire: JFK shot when you were eight. Malcolm X when you were nine. MLK and RFK when you were thirteen—two assassinations in two months, 1968. Vietnam on the evening news every night. Watergate hearings when you were eighteen. You grew up believing in American institutions, then watched them lie, fail, and kill. Trust became something you verified.</p><p>Your generation gets blamed for everything now: the housing crisis, climate change, the national debt, helicopter parenting, avocado toast economics. Some criticism is fair—your generation did vote for policies that benefited yourselves at others' expense. But individuals aren't generations. You didn't personally cause the housing crisis any more than a single Millennial personally killed department stores.</p><p>What's undeniable: you came of age during unprecedented prosperity and rode that wave for decades. Houses were affordable. Wages kept pace with productivity. A summer job could pay for a year of college. The American Dream wasn't a slogan—it was a reasonable expectation. That experience shaped assumptions that don't match the world you're leaving behind.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Bill Haley's 'Rock Around the Clock' hit number one the year you were born. Chuck Berry released 'Maybellene.' Little Richard recorded 'Tutti Frutti.' Elvis Presley signed with RCA Records and started his climb. You arrived just as rock and roll exploded—the soundtrack of your childhood was being invented in real time.</p><p>At two, you were too young to care, but your older cousins were going crazy over Elvis on Ed Sullivan (September 1956, shot from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous). By five, you knew the words to 'Hound Dog' even if you didn't understand them. By seven, you had opinions about whether Ricky Nelson or Fabian was better. The answer was always Elvis.</p><p>Television was your babysitter, your teacher, your window to the world. You grew up on The Mickey Mouse Club (Annette was your first crush, admit it), Captain Kangaroo, Howdy Doody reruns. At six, The Flintstones premiered—a cartoon in prime time, for adults, that you watched anyway. The Twilight Zone gave you nightmares. Leave It to Beaver made you wonder why your family wasn't that calm.</p><p>At nine, the Beatles arrived. February 9, 1964, Ed Sullivan Theater. Seventy-three million people watched. You were one of them. The screaming started and didn't stop for a decade. Within months, you had Beatles cards, Beatles wigs, Beatles everything. Your parents thought it was noise. They were wrong.</p><p>Your teenage years tracked the sixties' acceleration. At ten: Motown—the Supremes, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye. At eleven: Dylan went electric and folk purists lost their minds. At twelve: 'Good Vibrations,' 'Paint It Black,' 'These Boots Are Made for Walkin'.' At thirteen: Sgt. Pepper, the Summer of Love, Monterey Pop. At fourteen: Woodstock. You were too young to go, but you knew it mattered. You might have had the album.</p><p>Movies followed the same arc. You grew up on Disney—Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians, Mary Poppins when you were nine. But by high school, the Hays Code was dead and Hollywood was making Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Graduate (1967), Easy Rider (1969). Violence, sex, nihilism, ambiguity—the movies grew up when you did. At fifteen, you saw Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. At seventeen, The Godfather. Your parents' cinema was dead. Yours was just beginning.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year you were born, Jonas Salk's polio vaccine was declared safe and effective. Your parents wept with relief—they remembered summers of closed swimming pools, iron lungs, children in braces. You'd never know that fear. Technology meant safety. Technology meant progress. Technology meant the future would be better than the past.</p><p>Your childhood technology was analog, mechanical, built to last. The rotary phone on the wall—seven digits, party lines in rural areas, long-distance calls saved for emergencies because they cost money. The television that took thirty seconds to warm up, vacuum tubes glowing orange before the picture appeared. Three channels, four if you were lucky, snow and static if the antenna wasn't adjusted right.</p><p>At two, Sputnik launched and America panicked. You don't remember it, but you lived its consequences: science education became a national priority, space became the frontier, and by the time you were in elementary school, astronauts were heroes. You collected trading cards with their faces. You built model rockets. You watched every launch.</p><p>At fourteen, you watched humans walk on the moon. July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong's grainy boot touching lunar dust. 'One small step.' You were glued to the television with 600 million other people—the largest audience in human history. For one night, the future arrived exactly as promised. Space colonies and flying cars couldn't be far behind. (They were.)</p><p>At seventeen, the first pocket calculator appeared—the HP-35, costing $395, three weeks' salary for many workers. You'd done math with slide rules. Now you didn't have to. At twenty-two, the Apple II launched. At twenty-six, the IBM PC. You watched offices transform from typewriters and carbon paper to glowing screens. 'Word processing' sounded like a factory. You adapted, because the alternative was obsolescence.</p><p>At forty, the internet arrived. You learned email (why would I need this?), then the World Wide Web (what's a browser?), then eventually, grudgingly, smartphones and social media. You've adapted to more technological change than any generation in history—from party lines to FaceTime, from vinyl records to streaming, from handwritten letters to texts. The learning never stopped. Neither did the suspicion that this wasn't all progress.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were you when Kennedy was shot? You were eight years old—third grade, November 22, 1963. The announcement came over the PA system or the teacher got a note. Adults cried. School let out early. For the next four days, America stopped. The funeral procession, the riderless horse, Jackie's black veil, John-John's salute. You learned that presidents could die, that history could happen without permission, that nothing was as safe as it seemed.</p><p>You were nine during Freedom Summer, 1964—three civil rights workers murdered in Mississippi, their bodies found in an earthen dam. You were ten when John Lewis led marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and state troopers beat them bloody on national television. Bloody Sunday. You watched it at dinner. The Civil Rights Movement wasn't history class. It was the evening news, every night, while your family ate.</p><p>At eleven, you watched Watts burn—six days of riots in Los Angeles, thirty-four dead. At twelve, Newark and Detroit. Cities on fire became a recurring image. Your parents whispered about 'changing neighborhoods' and 'crime.' You were learning, slowly, that America had problems nobody on Leave It to Beaver mentioned.</p><p>At thirteen, 1968 happened. April 4: Martin Luther King Jr. assassinated in Memphis. Cities exploded again. June 5: Robert Kennedy shot in Los Angeles, died the next day. August: the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, police beating protesters while the whole world watched. You were old enough to understand that the country was cracking. You weren't old enough to know if it could be fixed.</p><p>At fourteen, you watched the moon landing—but also Woodstock, Altamont, the Manson murders, My Lai. The same year: hope and horror, achievement and atrocity. At fifteen, Kent State: National Guard shooting college students. At seventeen, Watergate broke. At nineteen, Nixon resigned. The president was a crook. The system caught him—eventually. The lesson was ambiguous.</p><p>At twenty, Saigon fell. April 30, 1975. Helicopters lifting off embassy rooftops, desperate crowds, the end of a war that defined your adolescence. You knew people who went to Vietnam. You might know people who didn't come back. At thirty-four, the Berlin Wall came down. At forty-six, September 11—you were at work, watching towers fall on a conference room television, knowing everything was about to change. At fifty-three, the financial system collapsed. At sixty-five, a pandemic locked you in your house. History keeps happening, whether you're ready or not.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated into chaos. If you finished high school in 1973, you entered a workforce being hammered by the oil embargo, stagflation, and the end of the post-war boom. If you went to college and graduated around 1977, it wasn't much better: unemployment above 7%, inflation above 6%, interest rates climbing toward double digits. The golden economy your parents described was over before you arrived.</p><p>The career ladder your father climbed—entry-level to corner office at one company, forty years, pension, gold watch—was already wobbling. You might have started at one company expecting lifetime employment. By the 1980s, 'restructuring' became a verb that happened to your colleagues, then to you. Layoffs weren't failures anymore; they were 'strategic realignment.'</p><p>But you adapted. The Reagan boom rewarded those who could pivot. You learned to network before anyone called it that. You switched companies when loyalty wasn't reciprocated. You acquired new skills—computing, spreadsheets, eventually email—because the alternative was obsolescence. By 1990, you'd survived enough downturns to recognize the pattern: panic, layoffs, recovery, repeat.</p><p>The workplace you entered had three-martini lunches and secretarial pools. The workplace you retired from had standing desks and Slack channels. In between: cubicles (Action Office II, 1968, became soul-crushing by 1988), open floor plans (supposed to encourage collaboration, actually encouraged distraction), remote work (pandemic necessity that became permanent). You've sat through every management fad: Quality Circles, Six Sigma, Agile, Holacracy. They all promised transformation. They all meant more meetings.</p><p>Your compensation tells a complicated story. If you're a white man who stayed employed and invested in the stock market, you probably accumulated significant wealth. If you're a woman, you spent your career earning 60 cents (1970s) to 82 cents (2020s) on the dollar. If you're Black, the wealth gap is even wider—structural barriers that existed when you entered the workforce still exist now, just better disguised.</p><p>Retirement arrived differently than expected. The pension you were promised became a 401(k) you managed yourself. Social Security helps but doesn't cover everything. Some of your peers retired at 62 and play golf. Some are working at 70 because they have to. The average hides enormous variation. Your generation accumulated more wealth than any before it, but 'your generation' isn't you—it's an aggregate that obscures who won and who lost.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when asking someone out meant calling their house, talking to their father first, and hoping nobody was listening on the extension? When a date meant picking her up at the door, meeting the parents, having a plan for the evening that didn't involve staring at screens? When the only way to stay in touch was letters, phone calls that cost money, and actually showing up?</p><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution. The birth control pill was FDA-approved in 1960, but it took years to become widely available. By the time you were dating seriously—late teens, early twenties—the rules had changed. Cohabitation before marriage went from scandal to common. Divorce lost most of its stigma. Your parents' courtship rituals (chaperoned dates, engagement within months, virgin brides) seemed quaint, restrictive, maybe hypocritical.</p><p>The average age at first marriage when you were born was 22 for men, 20 for women. By the time you married—probably late 1970s or early 1980s—it had crept up a few years. Still young by today's standards. Some of those marriages lasted. Many didn't. The divorce rate peaked around 1980, when you were twenty-five. Nearly half of marriages from your era ended in divorce. Yours might have too. No judgment—the expectations placed on marriage in your generation were contradictory and often impossible.</p><p>Blended families became normal. Your kids might have step-siblings, half-siblings, multiple sets of grandparents. Holiday logistics became complex. The nuclear family of your childhood TV shows—Mom, Dad, 2.3 kids, dog—turned out to be a snapshot, not a template. Families got messier. Arguably, they got more honest.</p><p>Communication technology reshaped relationships across your lifetime. The wall phone with the long cord you stretched into the closet for privacy. The answering machine that let you screen calls. Call waiting, voicemail, email, texting, FaceTime. Each upgrade required learning. You adapted because your kids and grandkids expected it. You can text now. You might even use emojis. The eye-roll one, probably, when your grandchildren send too many.</p><p>Your oldest friendships span sixty years—people who remember when you had hair, when you were thin, when you made mistakes you'd rather forget. Some friendships survived distance, marriage, divorce, death. Some faded without drama. Geography used to determine friendship: you were close to whoever lived nearby. Now you can maintain relationships across any distance, theoretically. In practice, it takes effort not everyone makes.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>The numbers tell a story your experience might confirm or contradict. When you turned twenty-one in 1976, the median home price was $44,200—about 2.8 times the median household income. When Millennials turned twenty-one, it was six times. Same ratio for college tuition, adjusted for inflation: four years at a public university cost about $2,000 in 1975; it costs $45,000 now. These aren't arguments. They're just math.</p><p>You entered adulthood during stagflation—the 1970s economy that wasn't supposed to be possible. Unemployment and inflation simultaneously high. Gas lines. Malaise. The economic orthodoxy of your parents' generation failed, and you learned early that experts could be wrong, that systems could break, that the rules could change without notice.</p><p>But then the rules changed in your favor. The Reagan boom of the 1980s. The Clinton expansion of the 1990s. If you bought a house in 1980 for $70,000, it's worth $400,000 now, and you didn't have to do anything except make mortgage payments. If you invested in the S&P 500 starting in 1982, you've averaged 10% annual returns for forty years. Time in the market matters more than timing the market—and you had the time.</p><p>Your generation controls over half of American wealth: roughly $76 trillion. Gen X holds about $46 trillion. Millennials, thirteen percent fewer people than Boomers but in their prime working years, hold about $13 trillion. The gap isn't just age—it's when you entered the markets and what prices looked like when you did.</p><p>Your financial anxieties are real but different. Healthcare costs can bankrupt retirees—one serious illness, one nursing home stay, can vaporize a lifetime of savings. You might outlive your money; longevity is a gift and a threat. Social Security helps but wasn't designed for thirty-year retirements. The pension you earned might have been converted to a 401(k) you manage yourself, for better or worse.</p><p>The 'great wealth transfer' everyone discusses is messier than advertised. You might have inherited from your parents. You might be supporting adult children who can't afford rent, let alone homes. You might be paying for grandchildren's college, covering a down payment, wondering whether helping is helping or enabling. Money flows in multiple directions now, and the arithmetic of generational wealth doesn't account for the flow backwards.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>The most dangerous advice you can give younger people is the advice that worked for you. 'Just work hard.' 'Save 10% of your income.' 'Get a good education and the jobs will follow.' 'Walk in and ask to speak to the manager.' None of this is wrong, exactly. It's just from a different economy—one where tuition wasn't a mortgage, where entry-level jobs didn't require three years of experience, where working hard actually correlated with getting ahead.</p><p>You came of age when a single income could buy a house, support a family, and fund retirement. That's not nostalgia or exaggeration—it's census data. The disconnect isn't that younger generations work less. It's that the same work buys less. When you say 'I did it, so can they,' you're comparing apples to a fruit that doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>Your generation tends to confuse correlation with causation. You worked hard and succeeded, so hard work causes success. But you also entered the workforce during a thirty-year economic expansion, bought houses before prices tripled, got degrees before they required decades of debt. The correlation between effort and reward was real. It was also historically specific. The causation might have been timing as much as virtue.</p><p>There's a reluctance to examine how much government policy helped. The GI Bill that sent your parents to college and bought their houses. The mortgage interest deduction that subsidized your home purchase. The employer-provided healthcare and pensions that meant benefits weren't your problem to solve. These weren't handouts—they were infrastructure. But infrastructure looks like personal achievement when you're standing on it.</p><p>Technology is another blind spot. You adapted to every change—computers, internet, smartphones—but adaptation isn't the same as understanding. The internet isn't just a faster library. Social media isn't just letters you type instead of write. The attention economy, the algorithm, the way information now works—these are structural changes, not just new tools. The instinct to dismiss what you don't fully understand is human. It's also limiting.</p><p>The hardest blind spot to see is the assumption that your experience is universal. The Boomer story—work hard, buy house, retire comfortably—was never universal, even within your generation. It was more available to white men than to anyone else. It was more available in some decades than others. Survivorship bias means the success stories write the history; the people for whom it didn't work aren't giving TED talks about hustle.</p>"

Your early adulthood was stagflation, gas lines, disco, and malaise. The economy didn't welcome you; you survived it. You probably got married in this decade—average age at first marriage was still under 25. You might have bought your first house, probably with an interest rate over 10%. Reagan's 'Morning in America' arrived in 1984. For some of you, it actually felt like morning.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1985-1995):</strong> Your building decade. The economy expanded. Wall Street boomed. The Cold War ended without nuclear war, which seemed less inevitable than you'd been raised to believe. You advanced in careers, accumulated equity, started families if you hadn't already. Your kids were born into a world of VCRs, cable TV, and Nintendo. The Berlin Wall fell when you were thirty-four. History was supposedly over. It wasn't.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1995-2005):</strong> Peak earning years. Your mortgage was getting manageable. Your 401(k) was growing. The Clinton economy delivered low unemployment and budget surpluses. The internet arrived; you learned email. The dot-com boom made paper millionaires. The dot-com crash unmade them. Then September 11, 2001—you were forty-six, probably at work, watching towers fall on a conference room TV. The world split into before and after, again.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2005-2015):</strong> You turned fifty as housing prices peaked and the system prepared to collapse. The 2008 financial crisis hit when you were fifty-three—your 401(k) lost a third of its value, your house might have gone underwater, younger colleagues got laid off. The recovery was slow. Your kids graduated into the worst job market since the Depression. You helped them more than you'd planned. Your parents aged, needing care. Sandwich generation: supporting both directions.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2015-2025):</strong> Retirement arrived, or didn't, depending on circumstances. Some of you left work at 62 with pensions and portfolios intact. Some couldn't afford to stop. COVID hit when you were sixty-five—highest risk category, locked in your house, watching the world through screens. Grandchildren you couldn't hug. Vacations you couldn't take. The golden years looked different than the brochure. Still: you're here. Many aren't.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2025+):</strong> You're seventy now, living longer than your parents or grandparents expected. Longevity is a gift and a problem. Healthcare costs can consume savings in months. Nursing homes cost more than most people saved. The systems designed to support you—Social Security, Medicare—are strained and politically contested. Your final decades depend partly on your choices, partly on luck, partly on whether younger generations decide to fund the programs you're counting on. You've seen enough history to know: nothing is guaranteed.</p>"

You're part of the 76 million Boomers who've been the dominant demographic force in America for most of your adult life. Politicians courted your vote. Marketers targeted your wallet. The culture was built around your preferences because there were so many of you. That dominance is ending now, and it's disorienting.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> Your parents' cohort. They grew up during the Depression and fought in World War II or Korea. They trusted institutions because institutions had delivered: victory, prosperity, progress. You learned to question those same institutions because you watched them lie about Vietnam, spy on citizens, and break laws from the Oval Office. They stayed married; you got divorced at historic rates. They saved; you spent. They were reticent; you went to therapy. Different times produced different people.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The forgotten middle children. They grew up in your shadow, latchkey kids while you were at work, watching you take the good jobs and houses before they could compete. They're more cynical than you—Watergate babies, raised on divorce, skeptical of optimism. They're also, quietly, the ones running most companies and institutions now while you argue with Millennials online. They don't complain because complaining isn't their style. It doesn't mean they've forgiven you.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> The numbers are stark. At age thirty-five, Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age: 7%. You bought houses for two years' salary. They can't buy houses at six. You had pensions and employer healthcare. They have student debt and gig work. The world you built isn't the world they inherited, and the advice you give—work hard, save money, show initiative—describes a reality that no longer exists. Their frustration isn't laziness. It's math.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Your grandchildren's generation. They've never known a world without the internet, without school shooting drills, without climate anxiety. They don't remember 9/11. They don't remember life before smartphones. Your childhood optimism—the sense that things generally improve—is incomprehensible to them. Their digital fluency is incomprehensible to you. The gap between your generations is wider than any gap before.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 69 years. You've exceeded that. Medical advances extended your runway; the question now is quality, not just quantity. You're living longer than your parents, but chronic disease, cognitive decline, and the sheer expense of aging complicate the picture. Longevity is a gift. It's also, sometimes, a burden. Nobody advertised that part.</p>"
