      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, setting off a boycott that would reshape America. Disneyland opened its gates in Anaheim that July. Ray Kroc franchised the first McDonald's. Elvis Presley signed with RCA Records. The world you entered was rebuilding, expanding, and about to change in ways nobody could predict.</p><p>Your childhood was suburban America at its mythological peak. Levittown-style developments sprouted across the landscape. Fathers commuted. Mothers stayed home—or at least that was the official story. The economy was booming. The GI Bill had sent your parents to college and helped them buy houses. Everything felt upward and onward, even if the cracks were already showing.</p><p>You learned to read during the Civil Rights Movement. You were eight when JFK was assassinated—probably in school, probably watching teachers cry. You were nine during Freedom Summer. Ten when Selma happened. The news your parents watched showed fire hoses, police dogs, sit-ins, and speeches. History wasn't something in textbooks. It was happening outside your window.</p><p>Technology-wise, you grew up with black-and-white television transitioning to color. Three channels, maybe four if you had good reception. The phone was attached to the wall with a rotary dial. Air conditioning was a luxury. Your entertainment was outside, with the neighborhood kids, until the streetlights came on.</p><p>Your generation was the first to grow up with the constant background hum of nuclear anxiety. Duck-and-cover drills were a regular part of elementary school. The Cold War wasn't abstract—it was a constant presence, a fear baked into your childhood like fluoride in the water.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the post-World War II spike in births—returning soldiers making up for lost time. Your generation is roughly 76 million people in the US, and for most of your life, you've been the dominant cultural and political force in America.</p><p>The defining moments for Boomers came in rapid succession: JFK's assassination, the Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam, Watergate. You grew up believing in institutions, then watched those institutions betray you repeatedly. Trust became conditional. Idealism curdled into cynicism for some, and hardened into activism for others.</p><p>Your generation invented the counterculture, then grew up to become the establishment it rebelled against. You went from Woodstock to Wall Street, from bell-bottoms to business casual. This isn't hypocrisy—it's just what happens when youthful revolution meets mortgages, kids, and retirement planning.</p><p>Boomers get blamed for a lot: the housing crisis, climate change, the national debt, participation trophies. Some of it's fair. Most of it ignores that individuals aren't responsible for systemic problems. You didn't personally destroy the economy any more than a Millennial personally killed the napkin industry.</p><p>What's undeniable is that you came of age during unprecedented prosperity and rode that wave for decades. The economy expanded. Real wages grew. Houses were affordable. College didn't require a second mortgage. The American Dream wasn't a slogan—it was an achievable reality. That experience shaped expectations that don't match the world younger generations inherited.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Marty McFly traveled back to in <em>Back to the Future</em>. That's your origin year in pop culture mythology—the perfect 1950s, before everything got complicated. Except, of course, it was already complicated. The nostalgia is selective.</p><p>The music of your childhood was early rock and roll. Elvis on Ed Sullivan, censored from the waist down. Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly. Your older siblings or cousins had the records. By the time you were a teenager, it was the British Invasion—Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who. You probably remember exactly where you were when you first heard 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.'</p><p>Television was three channels of family programming: <em>I Love Lucy</em>, <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>, <em>The Andy Griffith Show</em>. Walter Cronkite delivered the news, and when he said that's the way it was, everyone believed him. TV dinners and TV trays became standard equipment. The screen was the new hearth.</p><p>Your teenage years coincided with the most seismic shift in pop culture history. Folk music went electric. Motown changed everything. Psychedelia took hold. By the late '60s, your generation was producing and consuming culture that terrified your parents: Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Doors. Woodstock happened when you were fourteen—old enough to want to go, probably too young to be allowed.</p><p>Movies tracked the same arc: from Technicolor musicals to <em>Easy Rider</em> and <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em>. The Hayes Code collapsed. Hollywood started making films for adults, with adult themes, and your generation was the audience that demanded it. You grew up on Disney and came of age with New Hollywood.</p><p>The pop culture you consumed was communal in ways that don't exist anymore. Everyone watched the same shows, listened to the same songs, saw the same movies. There were no niches, no algorithms, no personalized feeds. Culture was shared because there was no alternative.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the first nuclear power plant opened in Arco, Idaho, and the polio vaccine was declared safe and effective. Technology in 1955 meant jet aircraft, automatic transmissions, and television spreading to every living room. The future was chrome, fins, and atomic optimism.</p><p>Your childhood technology was analog and mechanical. Rotary phones. Manual typewriters. Slide rules for math class. The calculator didn't exist until you were in your late teens, and it cost more than a car payment. Computers were room-sized machines that only governments and corporations could afford.</p><p>You were fourteen when humans landed on the moon. That was the technological apex of your youth—watching Neil Armstrong's grainy image on television, knowing that anything was possible. Space was the frontier. Technology was liberation.</p><p>You entered the workforce just as personal computers began emerging. The Apple II came out when you were twenty-two. The IBM PC when you were twenty-six. You watched offices transform from typewriters and carbon paper to word processors and email. You adapted, because you had to, but you remember when 'cut and paste' involved scissors and glue.</p><p>The internet arrived in your forties. You learned email, then web browsing, then maybe social media. You've spent more time adapting to technological change than any generation before you—from rotary phones to smartphones, from vinyl records to streaming, from handwritten letters to text messages. The learning never stopped.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is practical. You use what works. You're not impressed by the latest gadget because you've seen dozens of 'latest gadgets' come and go. You remember when the answering machine was revolutionary. Perspective breeds patience.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were eight when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. You probably remember that day with perfect clarity—the announcement over the school PA system, teachers crying, being sent home early. It was the first time you understood that the world could break without warning.</p><p>You were nine during Freedom Summer, when civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi. Ten when Selma exploded onto television screens. Eleven when Watts burned. The Civil Rights Movement wasn't history—it was your childhood's constant companion, playing out on the evening news while you ate dinner.</p><p>You were fourteen when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated two months apart. That summer of 1968 also brought the Democratic National Convention riots in Chicago. You were old enough to understand that the country was coming apart at the seams.</p><p>Vietnam defined your late adolescence. You came of draft age just as the war was winding down—the lottery system began in 1969 when you were fourteen. By the time you were eighteen, the draft was ending, but you knew people who went. You knew people who didn't come back. You watched the war on television every night.</p><p>You were nineteen when Nixon resigned over Watergate. You'd watched the hearings, seen the system work—sort of. The president was a crook. He got caught. He left. It was supposed to prove the system could self-correct. Whether it actually did depends on your level of optimism.</p><p>You were forty-six on September 11, 2001. Probably at work, probably watched it on television in a conference room or break room. By then, you'd seen enough history to know what was coming: war, fear, surveillance, a country that would never quite be the same.</p><p>You were fifty-three when the 2008 financial crisis hit. Your 401(k) probably took a beating. Your house might have lost value. You watched younger people lose everything they'd worked for, and you remembered 1973, 1987, 2001—the pattern of crashes that punctuate American capitalism.</p><p>You were sixty-five when COVID-19 arrived, putting you in the highest-risk category. The pandemic may have accelerated your retirement or delayed it. Either way, you spent your mid-sixties masked, isolated, and reminded that history isn't done with you yet.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1977, depending on whether you went to college. The economy was in stagflation—high unemployment, high inflation, no good options. Gas lines. Malaise. Carter in a cardigan telling everyone to turn down the thermostat. It wasn't the golden opportunity your parents promised.</p><p>But things improved. Reagan's '80s brought deregulation, economic expansion, and the beginning of the corporate culture that would dominate for decades. You rode that wave. If you played it right, you built a career, got promoted, accumulated wealth. The system worked for people who looked like the system's designers.</p><p>Your generation invented the modern workplace. Cubicles. Corporate retreats. 'Synergy.' You sat through the first PowerPoint presentations. You learned to cc: and then bcc:. You watched secretarial pools disappear and everyone start doing their own typing.</p><p>You've had bosses from the Silent Generation and managed Millennials. You've seen workplace culture shift from three-martini lunches to wellness programs, from lifetime employment to constant restructuring. You've survived layoffs, mergers, acquisitions, and 'right-sizing.' The corporate vocabulary of euphemism is your native tongue.</p><p>Retirement, if you've reached it, probably doesn't look like your parents' retirement. You might still be working part-time. You might be consulting. Full stop, feet up, gold watch retirement is increasingly rare. Social Security helps but doesn't cover everything. The pension you were promised might have been converted to a 401(k) somewhere along the way.</p><p>Your generation accumulated more wealth than any before it, but the distribution is uneven. Some Boomers are millionaires. Some are working retail in their seventies because they can't afford not to. Averages hide the reality of winners and losers.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution. The pill became widely available. Cohabitation became acceptable. Divorce lost its stigma. The rules your parents followed didn't apply anymore—or at least, you could pretend they didn't.</p><p>You probably got married younger than Millennials do, but older than your parents did. The average age at first marriage climbed throughout your lifetime. So did the divorce rate—peaking around 1980, when you were twenty-five. Half of your generation's marriages ended in divorce. Yours might have too.</p><p>Communication in your formative years meant letters, phone calls, and showing up. Long-distance relationships required commitment—actual stamps, actual waiting. You courted people in person. You had conversations that lasted hours because there was nothing else to do.</p><p>You've watched communication technology transform repeatedly. Answering machines. Call waiting. Voicemail. Email. Texting. Video calls. Each generation of technology changed how relationships worked. You adapted, sometimes grudgingly, because staying connected to children and grandchildren required it.</p><p>Your generation's family structures are complicated. Divorce and remarriage created blended families, step-siblings, half-siblings, multiple sets of grandparents. Holiday scheduling became a logistical challenge. The nuclear family your childhood idealized splintered into something messier and, arguably, more honest.</p><p>Friendship patterns changed too. You might have childhood friends you've known for sixty years. You might have lost touch with everyone from before. Geography mattered more when you were young—you were friends with whoever lived nearby. Now you can maintain relationships across any distance, but it takes effort that not everyone makes.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You came of age during stagflation, which taught you that the economy can be terrible in multiple ways simultaneously. High inflation and high unemployment weren't supposed to coexist. Economic orthodoxy said so. Economic reality disagreed.</p><p>But you also experienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history. The '80s and '90s were good to people who had assets. The stock market climbed. Housing prices rose. If you bought a house in 1980, it's worth ten times what you paid. If you invested in the S&P 500 in 1982, you've done extremely well.</p><p>Your generation's wealth accumulation is historically unprecedented. Boomers control over half of America's wealth—roughly $76 trillion. Gen X has about $46 trillion. Millennials have about $13 trillion. The disparity isn't just age—it's when you entered the market and what prices looked like.</p><p>You probably own your home outright or have a mortgage that's nearly paid off. You bought when buying was possible. The house that cost $50,000 in 1980 is worth $500,000 now. That's not because you're smarter—it's because you were born at the right time.</p><p>Your financial anxieties are different from younger generations'. You worry about healthcare costs, which can bankrupt retirees. You worry about outliving your savings. You worry about what to leave your kids, and whether leaving them anything is even possible given how expensive elder care has become.</p><p>The intergenerational wealth transfer everyone talks about is complicated. You might have inherited from your parents. You might be supporting adult children who can't afford housing. You might be paying for grandchildren's education. Money flows in multiple directions now, not just down the generational ladder.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is underestimating how much the economy has changed. When you tell younger people to just work hard and they'll get ahead, you're describing a reality that no longer exists. The job market, the housing market, the education market—none of them work like they did when you were young. Advice that worked in 1977 can sound delusional in 2025.</p><p>You came of age when a single income could support a family, buy a house, and fund retirement. That's not entitlement speaking—it's historical fact. But it means you sometimes can't see why younger generations are struggling. If hard work was enough for you, why isn't it enough for them? The answer is structural, not individual, but that's hard to accept.</p><p>Your generation also tends to underestimate technology's downsides. You were promised that automation would create leisure. Instead, it created surveillance, gig work, and the expectation that everyone is always available. The internet was supposed to democratize information. It also democratized misinformation. The tech optimism of your youth aged poorly.</p><p>Health is another blind spot. Your generation assumed retirement would be golden years of travel and grandchildren. Medical advances keep you alive longer but not necessarily healthier. The last decades of life are often expensive, painful, and dependent on systems—healthcare, Social Security, family—that are under strain.</p><p>There's also a tendency to see your generation's journey as universal when it was actually specific to a time and place. The post-war boom was an anomaly, not a baseline. The prosperity you experienced was built on specific conditions—cheap energy, American manufacturing dominance, favorable demographics—that won't return. The world your children and grandchildren inherited is fundamentally different, and recognizing that difference matters.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation, oil crises, and Watergate's aftermath. The '70s were not the golden age that '50s nostalgia pretended. But you found your footing. You started careers, got married, maybe had kids. The economy improved by decade's end. Reagan arrived promising morning in America, and for many of you, it actually felt like morning.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> This was your building decade. Career advancement, family formation, home buying. The '80s economy rewarded ambition. You might have gotten your first management position, your first real salary, your first sense that you'd actually made it. Gordon Gekko said greed was good. Some of you believed him.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Peak earning years for many. Kids in school, mortgage getting paid down, 401(k) growing. The '90s were boom times—dot-com money, low unemployment, the end of history (supposedly). You started thinking seriously about retirement, about what comes next. Some of you made partner. Some of you got downsized in 'restructuring.'</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> The dot-com crash, 9/11, and the slow recovery afterward. Your kids left home or didn't. Your parents aged and needed help. You became the sandwich generation—supporting people on both ends of the age spectrum. Retirement planning became urgent. Health issues started appearing. AARP kept sending mail.</p><p><strong>Your 60s ({{SIXTIES_START}}-present):</strong> The 2008 crash hit right as some of you were planning to retire. Plans changed. The recovery was slow. Then COVID arrived, putting your generation at the highest risk. Retirement, if it happened, happened under strange circumstances—socially isolated, worried about health, watching the world change faster than ever. Some of you are thriving in retirement. Some are working because you have to. Most are somewhere in between.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond:</strong> You're living longer than any generation before, but longevity brings its own challenges. Healthcare costs, cognitive decline, the loss of friends and siblings. You're redefining what old age looks like—more active, more engaged, but also more expensive and more complicated. The systems designed to support you—Social Security, Medicare—are strained. Your final decades will be shaped by how well those systems hold together.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.1 million people born in 1955—near the peak of the Baby Boom. The entire Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US. You've been the dominant demographic force for most of your adult life, which means the world was built around your preferences.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you're more rebellious, more divorced, and more skeptical of institutions. The Silent Generation trusted authority. You learned to question it—sometimes too late, but you learned. They retired comfortably. Your retirement is more uncertain.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're wealthier, more optimistic, and more annoying. Gen X grew up in your shadow, watching you take all the good jobs and houses before they could compete. They're the middle child generation—too young for Woodstock, too old for MySpace. They inherited your messes and got blamed for not fixing them fast enough.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. You controlled 21% of the nation's wealth at their age. They control 7%. You bought houses for a year's salary. They spend a year's salary on rent. You had pensions. They have debt. The world you built isn't the world they inherited, and they're not wrong to be frustrated about it.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from a different planet. They've never known a world without the internet, without school shootings, without climate anxiety. Your childhood optimism is incomprehensible to them. Their digital fluency is incomprehensible to you. The gap is wider than any before.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 69 years. You've outlived that already if you're reading this. Medical advances extended your runway. The question now is quality of life, not just quantity. You're living longer but not necessarily better. That's the trade-off nobody advertised.</p>"
