      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1965-1977</h2><p>You were born the year LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act and American combat troops first landed in Vietnam. Malcolm X was assassinated in February. Watts erupted in August. The country was tearing itself apart, and you were too young to notice—which is probably for the best.</p><p>Your earliest memories are Vietnam on the evening news. Walter Cronkite narrating footage of helicopters and jungle firefights while your family ate dinner. Body counts announced like sports scores. You didn't understand what war meant, but you understood that something terrible was happening far away, and that adults couldn't agree on whether it was right.</p><p>Nixon was elected when you were three. Watergate happened when you were seven. You watched a president resign on live television at nine years old. The message was clear before you had words for it: authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust nothing.</p><p>Your childhood was latchkey. Both parents worked, or one parent worked and the other was absent. You came home to an empty house, made your own snacks, watched television until someone showed up. Benign neglect was just called childhood. You learned self-reliance because no one was around to rely on.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant cartoons—Scooby-Doo, Fat Albert, Land of the Lost. Summers meant running around outside until streetlights came on. No helmets on bikes. No seatbelts in cars. No sunscreen. The entire concept of child safety was different. You survived by accident as much as design.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Gen X</h2><p>You're Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. The forgotten middle child of American generations—too young for Vietnam, too old for the internet boom. Your cohort is roughly 65 million people in the US, sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials.</p><p>The defining characteristic of your generation is skepticism. You grew up watching institutions fail in real time. Vietnam. Watergate. Three Mile Island. The hostage crisis. By the time you hit adulthood, you'd seen enough to know that authority was performative and promises were provisional.</p><p>They called you slackers, which was unfair. You weren't lazy—you just refused to pretend the game was worth playing by the old rules. You saw your parents' generation sell out their ideals for corner offices and stock options. You decided you'd rather be genuine and poor than phony and comfortable.</p><p>Your generation invented irony as a survival mechanism. When everything is suspect, sincerity feels naive. Better to be detached, knowing, slightly above it all. This made you difficult to manipulate but also difficult to mobilize. You're suspicious of movements, wary of enthusiasm, allergic to earnestness.</p><p>You're the last generation to grow up fully analog. You remember card catalogs. You remember looking things up in encyclopedias. You remember having to actually know things because you couldn't just Google them. The internet arrived when you were already formed, which gives you a perspective that younger generations lack.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year The Sound of Music dominated theaters and The Beatles released 'Help!' Bob Dylan went electric at Newport and folk purists lost their minds. James Brown recorded 'Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,' inventing funk in the process. The British Invasion was in full swing, and American music was scrambling to keep up.</p><p>Television in 1965 gave you I Dream of Jeannie, Get Smart, and Lost in Space. The networks were still in their big three monopoly—CBS, NBC, ABC. You got maybe seven channels if you were lucky, and someone had to get up to change them.</p><p>Your childhood was defined by disaster movies, Blaxploitation films, and the rise of the blockbuster. Jaws came out when you were ten. Star Wars when you were twelve. Those films shaped how movies were made, marketed, and experienced. You remember waiting in lines that wrapped around buildings.</p><p>Musically, you grew up with disco, then watched it die at Comiskey Park when you were fourteen. Punk emerged as the antidote—raw, fast, confrontational. By high school, you had MTV, which meant you saw music instead of just hearing it. New wave, synth-pop, early hip-hop—your teenage years were a genre explosion.</p><p>Your pop culture was monoculture. Everyone watched the same shows, heard the same songs, quoted the same movies. There was no algorithm feeding you personalized content. When something was popular, it was popular for everyone. M*A*S*H's finale had 105 million viewers. That kind of shared experience doesn't exist anymore.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Early Bird became the first commercial communications satellite and Gordon Moore articulated his famous law about transistor density. The computer age was coming, but it was still measured in mainframes and punch cards. Personal computing was science fiction.</p><p>Your childhood technology was analog and mechanical. Rotary phones. Typewriters. Slide rules for the math kids. Television was still black and white in many homes. Color was a luxury. Remotes didn't exist—you were the remote.</p><p>The pocket calculator arrived when you were seven, which seems quaint now but was revolutionary then. Pong came out when you were seven. The Apple II launched when you were twelve. The personal computer crept into existence during your adolescence, though most people still had no idea what to do with one.</p><p>You were twenty when the Macintosh introduced the graphical user interface to the masses. Twenty-four when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. Thirty when Amazon launched. Thirty-two when Google went live. You didn't grow up with the internet—you watched it grow up around you.</p><p>This gives you a unique perspective. You're old enough to remember life without screens, young enough to have mastered them. You adapted to technology rather than being shaped by it. You can still entertain yourself without a device. You know what boredom feels like. Gen Z has no idea.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born into the Civil Rights era. The Voting Rights Act passed months after your birth. Selma had just happened. The legal architecture of segregation was finally being dismantled, though the social reality would take much longer to shift.</p><p>You were three when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Two months later, Robert Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles. 1968 was the year America seemed to come apart—riots, protests, violence, chaos. You don't remember it directly, but its aftershocks shaped your entire childhood.</p><p>Vietnam ended when you were ten. You watched the fall of Saigon on television—helicopters evacuating the embassy, desperate crowds, the humiliation of American retreat. Your country had lost a war. That wasn't supposed to happen.</p><p>You were fourteen when the Iranian hostage crisis began. Fifteen when Reagan was elected on a promise to restore American greatness. Eighteen when the Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 American servicemembers. Your coming-of-age happened against a backdrop of American vulnerability and reasserted militarism.</p><p>You were twenty-four when the Berlin Wall fell. Twenty-six when the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War that had defined your entire life simply ended. Your generation grew up practicing duck-and-cover drills, expecting nuclear annihilation. Then one day the enemy just... wasn't there anymore.</p><p>You were thirty-six during 9/11. Old enough to have kids of your own by then, probably. Old enough to understand exactly how the world was about to change. Old enough to remember what America felt like before fear became the default setting.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the mid-1980s, when Reagan-era economics meant deregulation, union-busting, and the beginning of the great American income divergence. The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was already being shredded.</p><p>Your generation was the first to experience mass corporate downsizing as normal. You watched companies lay off thousands while executives got bonuses. You learned early that loyalty was a one-way street. The phrase 'rightsizing' entered the vocabulary. It meant the same thing as 'you're fired,' but with better PR.</p><p>You were in your late twenties during the dot-com boom. Some of you rode it up. Many watched from the sidelines, skeptical of the hype, which turned out to be both wise and costly. Being right about the bubble didn't make you rich. Being wrong and lucky did.</p><p>By your forties, you were mid-career during the 2008 financial crisis. Not young enough to start over easily, not old enough to have accumulated real wealth. The recession wiped out savings, destroyed housing equity, and reminded everyone that security was an illusion.</p><p>Your generation never fully recovered from the expectation that work should mean something. You wanted careers, not just jobs. You wanted to matter. The economy responded by creating more bullshit jobs, more meaningless meetings, more corporate speak. You learned to play the game while resenting every minute of it.</p><p>Now you're the ones in charge—or at least in middle management. You're trying to mentor Millennials and Gen Z while they look at you like relics from another era. You remember when showing up physically was the whole job. They work from coffee shops and expect mental health days. You're not sure who's right anymore.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You grew up when relationships happened in person, by accident, through proximity. You met people at parties, through friends, at work, in bars. Dating meant calling someone's house and talking to their roommate or parent first. Romance required effort and nerve in ways that apps have made obsolete.</p><p>Your generation married later than your parents but earlier than Millennials. The average age crept up, but marriage was still expected. Divorce had been normalized by your parents' generation—you knew plenty of kids from broken homes—but you still mostly believed in the institution. Cautiously.</p><p>Communication evolved dramatically during your adult life. You went from landlines to answering machines to cell phones to smartphones. Each transition changed how relationships worked. Being unreachable used to be normal. Now it's suspicious.</p><p>You're the last generation to have handwritten love letters, to have called someone just to hear their voice, to have experienced the agony of waiting by the phone. You also experienced the transition to email, then texting, then the current era of constant low-grade connection. You've seen both sides.</p><p>Your friendships are different from younger generations. You have fewer close friends but deeper relationships. You don't maintain hundreds of connections online—you have a handful of people you'd actually call in a crisis. Quality over quantity, though sometimes quantity would be nice too.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You entered the economy at a pivot point. The postwar boom was over. Inflation was being tamed but at the cost of crushing interest rates. Buying a house in the early '80s meant mortgages at 18%. Your financial life started on hard mode, which actually prepared you well for what came later.</p><p>Your generation caught the tail end of defined-benefit pensions and the beginning of the 401(k) era. You're split between those who got in early enough to benefit from the old system and those who arrived just as the ladder was being pulled up. The difference is significant.</p><p>You were thirty-five during the dot-com crash, forty-three during the 2008 crisis, and fifty-five during COVID. Three major economic disruptions during your prime earning years. You've learned that markets crash, that stability is temporary, that nothing is guaranteed.</p><p>Your relationship with money is pragmatic. You save because you've seen what happens when you don't. You invest because inflation eats cash. You don't trust the system, but you participate because the alternative is worse. You're cynical enough to expect collapse, practical enough to plan anyway.</p><p>You're probably in better financial shape than Millennials, worse than Boomers. You had the advantage of cheaper housing early on, the disadvantage of stagnant wages and rising costs. You've accumulated some wealth, but not as much as the generation before you, and you worry about whether it's enough.</p><p>Retirement is on your mind now. You're doing the math and it's not always encouraging. Social Security might not be there when you need it. Healthcare costs are terrifying. The golden years your parents enjoyed—pensions, Medicare, stability—feel less certain for you.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's skepticism, which served you well in many ways, can curdle into cynicism that prevents engagement. You're so convinced that systems are broken that you sometimes don't bother trying to fix them. Ironic detachment is a defense mechanism that can become a prison.</p><p>You have a tendency to dismiss younger generations as soft, entitled, or overly sensitive. The 'participation trophy' jokes got old a decade ago, but some of you are still making them. Millennials and Gen Z face different challenges than you did—not easier ones, just different. Your condescension isn't earned.</p><p>Your self-reliance can become isolation. You grew up being told to handle things yourself, not to burden others, to be independent. This made you capable but also bad at asking for help. You suffer in silence when you don't have to. Vulnerability isn't weakness, but your generation often treats it that way.</p><p>You can be technologically complacent. You adopted the internet, smartphones, and social media, but you did it as adults, after your habits were formed. Some of you stopped adapting around 2010. The digital landscape has changed dramatically since then, and not all of you have kept up.</p><p>Your generation has a complicated relationship with activism. You were raised by Boomers who talked endlessly about the '60s, about changing the world, about movements that mattered. Then you watched those same Boomers sell out. It made you suspicious of grand causes, which is understandable, but the world still needs people who show up.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1985-1995):</strong> You entered the workforce during the Reagan-Bush era. The economy was recovering from the early '80s recession, but good jobs were already getting harder to find. You probably changed jobs several times. Loyalty was dying; you learned to look out for yourself. This was your decade of figuring out who you were while the old rules stopped applying.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1995-2005):</strong> The internet changed everything. Some of you rode the dot-com wave; others watched skeptically from the sidelines. Y2K was a bust. 9/11 reshaped the world. By the end of this decade, you had kids, mortgages, responsibilities. The freedom of your twenties gave way to the obligations of middle adulthood. You were building something, even if you weren't sure what.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2005-2015):</strong> The 2008 crash hit you hard—not young enough to recover easily, not old enough to have already accumulated wealth. You spent this decade rebuilding, reassessing, wondering if the sacrifices were worth it. Your kids became teenagers, which brought its own challenges. You were sandwiched between aging parents and demanding children. Sleep was a luxury.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2015-2025):</strong> You're in this decade now. Peak earning years, theoretically, but also peak expenses—college tuition, healthcare, maybe helping aging parents. Retirement is visible on the horizon but not quite reachable. You're tired in ways that don't fully go away. But you're also more settled, more certain about what matters, less worried about what doesn't. The anxieties of youth have been replaced by the anxieties of mortality.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2025-2035):</strong> Retirement becomes real. Some of you will retire early; most won't be able to afford it. Healthcare decisions get more serious. Grandchildren might arrive. Your role shifts from builder to advisor, from doing to watching. The world will belong to younger people. Your job is to let go gracefully, which is harder than it sounds.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2035+):</strong> The generations you raised will be running things. Whether they do it well depends partly on what you taught them. You'll have stories to tell about a world before the internet, before smartphones, before everything changed. Whether anyone wants to hear them is another question. Aging isn't for the faint of heart, but you've never been faint of heart. You'll manage. You always have.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.8 million people born in 1965. The entire Gen X generation is about 65 million people in the US, making it the smallest of the major generations—squeezed between the massive Boomer cohort and the nearly-as-large Millennials.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), you're less idealistic but more realistic. They had their movements and their moments; you had their aftermath. They got cheap housing, affordable college, and pensions. You got what was left. The wealth transfer between generations has been staggeringly unequal, and you're on the short end.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're more self-reliant but less collaborative. They grew up with helicopter parents; you grew up with absent ones. They expect institutions to work for them; you expect institutions to fail. They're comfortable with therapy and emotional processing; you're more likely to bottle it up and move on.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from another planet. They've never known a world without internet, smartphones, or social media. You remember rotary phones and card catalogs. They're anxious about climate change and fascism; you were anxious about nuclear war. Different existential threats, same underlying dread.</p><p>Your life expectancy is around 76-78 years, which is slightly lower than Boomers' due to deaths of despair—suicide, overdose, alcoholism. Your generation has struggled more with these issues than those before or after. The 'forgotten generation' label has a dark truth to it.</p><p>But you've also been resilient, adaptable, and quietly competent. You built the internet companies. You raised the kids who are now changing things. You held things together through multiple crises without much credit. That's your legacy—doing the work without needing applause.</p>"
