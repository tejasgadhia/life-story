      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year the World Trade Center was bombed for the first time. A truck full of explosives in a parking garage killed six people and injured over a thousand. It was supposed to collapse the towers. It didn't. The building stayed standing for another eight years. You were eight when they finished the job.</p><p>Bill Clinton was inaugurated two months before you arrived. The Cold War had just ended. The Soviet Union was two years dead. America was supposed to be entering a new era of peace and prosperity. Your parents believed it. They had no reason not to. The '90s were optimistic in a way that feels almost quaint now.</p><p>Your childhood was the last of the analog era, but you caught the digital wave just in time to be fluent in both. You probably had a Nintendo or Sega Genesis before you had a home computer. You learned to type in computer class, not at home. The internet existed, but it was a thing that happened in the den, tied to a phone line, making sounds like a robot having a seizure.</p><p>You were four when Princess Diana died. Six when the Lewinsky scandal broke. Seven when Columbine happened. Eight when the Y2K panic turned out to be nothing. These were the dinner table conversations of your childhood, the background noise of your formative years. You learned early that the world was complicated and adults were often wrong.</p><p>Your childhood was Nickelodeon and Pokemon and Beanie Babies. It was Tamagotchis dying in your pocket because you forgot to feed them. It was Saturday morning cartoons and VHS tapes from Blockbuster. It was the last era when being unreachable was normal. Your parents couldn't text you. They had to trust you'd come home when the streetlights came on.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Jurassic Park terrified everyone with CGI dinosaurs and Schindler's List made everyone cry in black and white. Spielberg had a year. Groundhog Day came out, which would become shorthand for existential repetition for the next three decades. Sleepless in Seattle proved that Tom Hanks could make rom-coms as well as he made dramas.</p><p>Musically, 1993 was the year Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' refused to leave the charts. Nirvana was at peak grunge. Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic and changed hip-hop forever. Janet Jackson, Snoop Dogg, and Mariah Carey were all releasing defining work. The '90s had a sound, and 1993 was ground zero.</p><p>TV in 1993 gave us The X-Files, which spent nine seasons asking 'what if the government is lying?' and never quite answering. Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered—Conan would host that show longer than you've held any job. NYPD Blue pushed the boundaries of what network TV could show, and everyone's parents complained about it.</p><p>Your childhood was peak '90s nostalgia material. Power Rangers. Rugrats. Boy Meets World. Fresh Prince. Friends started when you were one and ended when you were eleven—you grew up with Ross and Rachel's drama playing in the background. Harry Potter arrived when you were four, and by the time you were a teenager, you were part of a generation that sorted themselves into Hogwarts houses unironically.</p><p>The pop culture of your youth was pre-streaming, pre-binging, pre-algorithm. You watched what was on when it was on, or you missed it. This taught patience, which is a skill your younger cousins will never develop. You couldn't demand entertainment on command. Entertainment showed up when it felt like it, and you were grateful.</p><p>By the time you hit middle school, TRL was appointment viewing. Britney, Christina, *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys—the late '90s pop explosion was your soundtrack. You probably had an opinion about Britney vs. Christina. You probably still do.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Mosaic launched—the first web browser with images. Most people didn't know what a web browser was. Most people didn't need to. The internet was 130 websites, total. It was a research tool for academics and a curiosity for hobbyists. By the time you were old enough to use it, it was eating the world.</p><p>Intel released the Pentium processor in 1993. This meant nothing to you at the time, but it meant your family's computer would get faster and cheaper throughout your childhood. Moore's Law was working overtime. Every year, technology got better. This felt like progress. It was, in ways that mattered. It was also, in ways that wouldn't become clear for decades, a trap.</p><p>You were two when Windows 95 launched. Four when the first DVDs arrived. Five when Google was founded in a garage. Seven when the first camera phones appeared. Ten when Myspace launched. Twelve when Facebook opened to high schoolers. Fourteen when the iPhone changed everything. You didn't grow up with smartphones—you watched them conquer civilization in real-time.</p><p>This makes you a digital native who remembers the analog world. You can use a touchscreen and a rotary phone. You know what dial-up sounds like. You've waited three minutes for a single image to load, line by line, like a revelation. You've also gotten annoyed when a page takes more than two seconds to load. You contain multitudes.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is complicated in ways that younger generations don't quite understand. You remember when social media didn't exist, when phones were for calling, when being offline was the default state. You've watched screen time colonize every waking moment. You know it's probably bad for you. You can't stop.</p><p>You're fluent enough to troubleshoot your parents' tech problems and wise enough to be suspicious of every new platform. You watched Facebook go from 'fun way to connect with college friends' to 'democracy-eroding misinformation machine.' You've seen this movie before. You're not optimistic about how it ends.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>The World Trade Center bombing happened a month before you were born. Six people died, over a thousand were injured, and America mostly forgot about it until September 2001. You were eight years old on 9/11. Old enough to understand something terrible was happening. Old enough to watch the towers fall on live television. Old enough for it to mark you permanently.</p><p>Your pre-9/11 memories are fuzzy but real. You remember a time when you could walk someone to an airport gate. When shoes didn't need to come off at security. When the word 'terrorism' wasn't a daily vocabulary word. That world ended before you turned ten.</p><p>You were five when Princess Diana died in a Paris tunnel. You probably didn't understand why the adults were crying, but you learned that collective grief was something people did together, usually watching television. You were six during the Lewinsky scandal, which taught you that adults lied about sex and then lied about lying about sex.</p><p>Columbine happened when you were six. School stopped feeling safe. Lockdown drills became normal. The phrase 'active shooter' entered the lexicon of childhood. You grew up preparing for violence in a way your parents never had to.</p><p>You were fifteen during the 2008 financial crisis. You watched your parents' retirement accounts evaporate. You watched neighbors lose homes. You learned that the economy wasn't a stable thing—it was a house of cards that rich people kept rebuilding with everyone else's money.</p><p>By the time you graduated college around 2015, the world had changed again. Same-sex marriage was legal. Smartphones were universal. Social media had rewired how humans communicated. Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign the same year. COVID hit when you were 27, which is young enough to survive easily but old enough to have your career derailed, your plans postponed, your sense of normal permanently warped.</p><p>You've lived through more 'unprecedented' events than most generations see in a lifetime. The only constant has been the certainty that something else unprecedented is coming.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated college around 2015, give or take. The economy had technically recovered from 2008, but 'recovered' meant 'stable enough for corporations to post record profits while wages stayed flat.' Entry-level jobs still wanted three to five years of experience. Unpaid internships were still treated as opportunities rather than exploitation.</p><p>You're young enough to have missed the worst of the Great Recession's job market, but old enough to have absorbed its lessons. You watched older Millennials struggle. You learned that loyalty to employers is a sucker's game. You learned that 'stable career' is an oxymoron. You learned to keep your resume updated and your options open.</p><p>Your generation normalized the side hustle because one income stream wasn't enough. You've probably driven for Uber, sold things on Etsy, freelanced on Fiverr, or monetized a hobby just to make ends meet. The gig economy isn't liberation—it's what happens when traditional employment stops paying living wages.</p><p>You've worked in offices with ping pong tables and 'unlimited PTO' that nobody takes because the culture punishes time off. You've been told to 'bring your whole self to work' by companies that would fire you the moment quarterly earnings dipped. You've sat through mandatory fun and team-building exercises that felt more like hostage situations than morale boosters.</p><p>Remote work became normal for you because of COVID. You proved you could do your job from anywhere. The reward was employers expecting you to be available everywhere, all the time, on your phone, in your pajamas, at 10 PM on a Sunday. Work-life balance became work-life blur.</p><p>You're in your early thirties now, which means you're old enough to have some career traction but young enough to feel like you're still waiting for things to stabilize. Spoiler: they won't. The stability your parents had isn't coming back. You've adapted to precarity because there was no other option.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were eight when the dot-com bubble burst. Fifteen during the 2008 financial crisis. Twenty-seven during the COVID-19 economic collapse. You've watched the economy implode three times before hitting thirty-five. This has given you a financial worldview best described as 'perpetually bracing for the next disaster.'</p><p>Your relationship with money is defined by scarcity that never quite lifts. You graduated with student loan debt that will follow you for decades. You watched housing prices climb 50%, 100%, 200% while your wages went up maybe 20%. The math doesn't work. It was never designed to work for you.</p><p>You save obsessively because you've seen how fast stability evaporates. You invest because you don't trust Social Security to exist when you're old, but you don't trust the stock market either, so you hedge, diversify, and hope. You're playing a rigged game because refusing to play means losing by default.</p><p>Boomers bought houses on a single income. Gen X got in before prices went parabolic. You're competing against investors who buy properties in cash and turn them into short-term rentals. Homeownership isn't a milestone anymore—it's a lottery you keep losing.</p><p>You've been lectured about avocado toast and subscription services by people who bought property for a year's salary and paid off mortgages before turning forty. The generational wealth gap is a chasm. You're on the wrong side of it. Your parents might own their home outright. You're calculating whether you can ever own one at all.</p><p>Your generation is redefining what financial success looks like out of necessity. It's not a house in the suburbs—it's paying rent in a city where the jobs are while pretending you're not one emergency away from disaster. It's not retiring at sixty-five—it's hoping you can eventually slow down before your body gives out. The American Dream got repriced, and you couldn't afford the markup.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You entered your twenties with Obama in the White House and left with Trump. You started the decade as a fresh college graduate, full of cautious optimism because the economy was supposedly recovering. You ended it questioning whether anything was stable, because nothing was. This was supposed to be your 'figuring it out' decade. It was actually your 'surviving while pretending to figure it out' decade. You changed jobs, changed cities, maybe changed careers entirely. You learned that the life script your parents followed didn't apply to you.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> You're in this window now. COVID hit early in your thirties and scrambled whatever plans you had. You're making more money than you did at twenty-five, but it still doesn't cover a down payment. You're watching friends buy houses and have kids, and you're either doing the same or wondering if you ever will. This is the decade where you're supposed to 'have it together,' but having it together looks different than it did for your parents. You're building stability on shifting ground, and you know it could shift again at any moment.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Statistically, this will be your peak earning decade. You'll have more experience, more authority, more clarity about what you want from life. You'll also be sandwiched between aging parents who need care and kids (if you have them) who still need support. Your body will start sending strongly worded letters about the lifestyle choices of your twenties. This is the decade where you either double down on the path you're on or blow it up and start over. Both are valid choices. Neither is easy.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> By this point, you'll have lived through at least four major economic crises, multiple 'once-in-a-generation' disasters that happened every few years, and a complete transformation of how humans communicate, work, and relate to each other. Retirement will be visible on the horizon but probably not reachable. You'll be mentoring people who don't understand why 2008 still haunts you. You'll catch yourself starting sentences with 'back in my day' and hating yourself for it.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_START}}+):</strong> Traditional retirement isn't guaranteed for your generation. It might be part-time work, phased retirement, or figuring out how to live on whatever Social Security still pays. Climate change will have reshaped geography and migration patterns. The technology landscape will be unrecognizable. You'll tell younger people about dial-up internet, VHS tapes, and a time when phones couldn't take pictures. They'll look at you like you're describing the Middle Ages. You survived more change than any generation since the Greatest Generation. That counts for something, even if it doesn't pay the bills.</p>"
