      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1954-1966</h2><p>You were born the year the Supreme Court ruled segregation unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, a decision that would take another decade to actually mean anything in most American schools. Dwight Eisenhower was president. The Korean War had just ended. McCarthyism was at its hysterical peak, with grown men in suits accusing each other of Communist sympathies on live television like it was a spectator sport.</p><p>Your childhood happened during the most prosperous period in American history. Single-income families bought houses in suburbs that didn't exist five years earlier. Your father probably worked one job that paid for everything. Your mother probably stayed home, which was less a choice than an expectation. The American Dream wasn't an aspiration—it was a consumer product available at your local Sears.</p><p>You were six when JFK was elected, nine when he was assassinated. That moment—where you were when you heard—is probably still vivid. The innocence of the postwar boom died in Dallas. Everything after felt different. Darker. More complicated.</p><p>Television raised you as much as your parents did. You watched Captain Kangaroo before school and The Mickey Mouse Club after. You saw the Ed Sullivan Show when Elvis shook America's hips and when the Beatles shook its hair. By the time you hit adolescence, Walter Cronkite was showing you the Vietnam War during dinner, and nobody asked if that was appropriate for children.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the literal boom of babies born after World War II, when returning soldiers and their sweethearts got busy building the future. Your generation is roughly 76 million people in the US—the largest until Millennials, who you now blame for everything from bad work ethic to the death of casual dining chains.</p><p>The defining moments for Boomers came in rapid succession: JFK's assassination, Vietnam, civil rights marches, Woodstock, Watergate. You lived through more social upheaval by age twenty-five than your parents experienced in their entire lives. The postwar certainty they'd worked so hard to create? You dismantled it in a decade.</p><p>Your generation invented youth culture as a concept. Before you, teenagers were just adults-in-waiting. You made youth a lifestyle brand. Rock and roll, counterculture, protests, free love, recreational drugs—you didn't invent all of it, but you scaled it. You turned rebellion into a generational identity.</p><p>Boomers are sandwiched between the Silent Generation (who kept their heads down and their mouths shut) and Gen X (who watched you break everything and decided not to care). You're idealistic enough to believe you changed the world, pragmatic enough to have eventually put on suits and joined the corporations you once protested.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year On the Waterfront won Best Picture and Marlon Brando showed everyone what modern acting looked like. 'I coulda been a contender' entered the language. Meanwhile, Elvis Presley was still a truck driver in Memphis, a year away from changing everything.</p><p>Musically, 1954 was the pivot point. Rock and roll was being born in Black churches and juke joints, about to crossover and terrify white parents everywhere. Bill Haley's 'Rock Around the Clock' came out that year, though it wouldn't hit until Blackboard Jungle made it famous. You were too young to notice, but by the time you did notice, Elvis had taken what Black artists created and made it palatable to suburban America.</p><p>Television in 1954 was establishing itself as the center of American life. Father Knows Best premiered. Tonight Starring Steve Allen launched the late-night format. Disneyland was about to open, turning a cartoon mouse into a real estate empire. Your childhood was the golden age of TV westerns—Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, Bonanza. Every boy wanted a cowboy hat.</p><p>Your adolescence belonged to the British Invasion, Motown, and the Summer of Love. You probably remember exactly where you were when you first heard the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. By high school, it was Woodstock and Hendrix and music that your parents didn't understand and weren't supposed to.</p><p>The pop culture of your youth was communal. Everyone watched the same three channels. Everyone heard the same songs on AM radio. There was no algorithm sorting you into niches. Popular culture was actually popular—shared, debated, experienced together.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Texas Instruments built the first transistor radio, shrinking vacuum tubes into something pocket-sized. The USSR had just opened the first nuclear power plant. UNIVAC was the size of a room and about as smart as a modern calculator. Technology in 1954 was still heavy, expensive, and institutional. Nobody had personal electronics because electronics weren't personal yet.</p><p>Color television was technically available in 1954, but nobody you knew had one. Your family probably got its first color set in the mid-60s, and it was furniture—a wooden console that dominated the living room. The remote control, when it arrived, felt like magic.</p><p>You were nineteen when ARPANET—the internet's grandfather—was created. Twenty-one when Intel made the first microprocessor. Thirty when IBM launched the personal computer. Forty-one when the World Wide Web went public. You watched technology transform from room-sized machines to pocket-sized phones, and you did it while actually understanding how each generation of devices worked.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is practical. You learned computers in your thirties and forties, when they entered offices. You adapted to email, then texting, then smartphones. You're not a digital native—you're a digital immigrant, and like all immigrants, you carry an accent from the old country.</p><p>You remember life before screens. Before constant connectivity. Before everyone was reachable all the time. You know what boredom felt like before phones filled every idle moment. That perspective makes you valuable in ways younger generations don't always recognize.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born the same year the Senate finally censured Joseph McCarthy, ending his reign of paranoid accusations. The Army-McCarthy hearings were on television—one of the first times Americans watched politics as entertainment. 'Have you no sense of decency, sir?' became the question that ended careers.</p><p>You were nine when JFK was assassinated in Dallas. You probably watched the funeral on television, along with most of America. Lee Harvey Oswald getting shot by Jack Ruby, live on camera—that was something new. Violence in real-time, broadcast into living rooms. It wouldn't be the last time.</p><p>You were fourteen when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, then Bobby Kennedy two months later. You were fifteen during Woodstock. Sixteen when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. The late sixties were compressed chaos—assassination, protest, riot, war, moon landing—all happening faster than anyone could process.</p><p>Vietnam was your generation's war. You were draft-eligible. You either went, or you knew people who went, or you protested against going, or you found ways not to go. Everyone had to take a position. There was no neutral ground. The war ended when you were twenty-one, having consumed most of your adolescence.</p><p>You were twenty during Watergate. You watched a president resign in disgrace, proving that the system could hold leaders accountable, or that it took this long to do so, depending on your perspective. Either way, trust in institutions took a hit from which it never fully recovered.</p><p>By thirty, Reagan was president and the counterculture was over. By thirty-five, the Berlin Wall fell. By forty-seven, 9/11 happened, and you watched the world you'd spent decades building become something unrecognizable. Again.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the early 1970s, during the oil crisis and stagflation—not exactly a golden era, but still a time when jobs came with pensions, benefits, and the reasonable expectation that loyalty would be rewarded. Companies weren't yet in the business of treating employees as disposable resources.</p><p>Your generation invented the concept of work-life balance, mostly by having no balance at all. You worked long hours because that's what ambitious people did. The corner office was the goal. The company car was the prize. Success meant climbing a ladder that actually existed.</p><p>You probably worked for fewer companies than your children will. Tenure mattered. Institutional knowledge mattered. You could spend thirty years at one firm and retire with a party, a gold watch, and a pension that actually supported retirement. This wasn't generosity—it was standard.</p><p>You watched the workplace transform. Computers arrived in the 1980s and terrified half your colleagues. Email arrived in the 1990s and created new expectations about response times. Globalization arrived and suddenly your job could be done by someone overseas for a fraction of the cost. You adapted because adaptation was survival.</p><p>Your generation reached peak earning power just as the rules changed. The loyalty contract broke. Pensions became 401(k)s. Job security became an oxymoron. You saw the shift happen, and you were senior enough to benefit from the old rules while everyone younger got stuck with the new ones.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're from the generation that dated without apps, married younger, and stayed married longer—though not always happily. Divorce was scandalous when you were young, then suddenly it was everywhere. Your generation normalized ending marriages that previous generations would have endured in silent misery.</p><p>You probably met your spouse at school, at work, at church, or through friends who knew friends. Dating meant asking someone out in person, which required actual courage. Rejection happened to your face, not through a left swipe. You wrote love letters by hand, on paper, that someone could keep forever or burn dramatically.</p><p>Communication in your youth was deliberate. Long-distance calls cost money, so you planned what you'd say. Letters took days to arrive, so you thought before writing. You couldn't text someone 'hey' at 2 AM—you had to commit to a conversation or don't have one at all.</p><p>Your generation had children earlier than Millennials but later than your parents. You raised kids during the latchkey era, when both parents working became normal and nobody had invented the term 'helicopter parenting' yet. Your kids had more freedom and less supervision than any generation before or since.</p><p>You've lived through the entire evolution of communication technology—from party lines to smartphones, from handwritten letters to emojis. You can still read cursive and probably resent that schools stopped teaching it. You know how to carry on a conversation without looking at a screen, which is becoming a lost art.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You entered adulthood when houses cost $25,000 and a good salary was $10,000 a year. You could work a summer job and pay for a semester of college. Gas was expensive during the oil crisis but still cheap by modern standards. The math of middle-class life actually worked.</p><p>Your relationship with money was shaped by parents who survived the Depression. They taught you to save, to avoid debt, to pay cash when possible. Credit cards existed but weren't ubiquitous. Mortgages were the only debt respectable people carried. Financial leverage was something banks did, not individuals.</p><p>You benefited from the longest bull market in history. The stock market went up and up and up from the early 1980s through your peak earning years. Real estate appreciated steadily. If you bought a house in the 1970s, you watched it become worth ten times what you paid. Wealth accumulation, for your generation, was almost automatic.</p><p>You controlled more wealth by your forties than any generation before you. This wasn't entirely your doing—you inherited an economy built by the New Deal and rode it to prosperity. But you also made choices that pulled the ladder up behind you. Tax cuts that benefited the wealthy. Deregulation that enriched the already rich. Policies that made your assets appreciate while making the next generation's assets unaffordable.</p><p>Your generation's financial success story is also the story of why younger generations can't replicate it. College costs exploded. Housing costs exploded. Healthcare costs exploded. The economic conditions that made your wealth possible no longer exist, and pretending otherwise doesn't make you popular at family dinners.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is confusing your economic success with moral virtue. You worked hard, yes. But you also entered the workforce when a single income bought a house, pensions existed, and college didn't require a second mortgage. The hard work was real. The conditions that rewarded it were specific to your era.</p><p>You're so certain about how things should be done that you sometimes can't see how things have changed. The advice that worked in 1980 doesn't work in 2024. 'Just walk in and ask for a job' doesn't work when applications are online. 'Buy less avocado toast' doesn't close a wealth gap measured in trillions.</p><p>You fought for civil rights and women's rights but sometimes struggle with rights movements that emerged after your formative years. The cultural shifts of the 2010s and 2020s—around gender, sexuality, race—feel to some of you like too much, too fast. You changed the world once and aren't always comfortable watching it change again.</p><p>You normalized workaholic culture and are sometimes confused when younger people don't want to replicate it. You sacrificed for the company, and the company rewarded you—but the company doesn't reward sacrifice anymore, and younger workers noticed. Loyalty is a transaction, not a virtue, when only one side honors the contract.</p><p>Your generation accumulated political power and isn't letting go. The average age of Congressional leadership keeps climbing. The same faces have held power for decades. You changed everything when you were young, then settled into the institutions you once challenged and defended them against the next wave of change. This is the way of all generations, but it doesn't make it easier to watch.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1974-1984):</strong> You entered adulthood during the oil crisis and stagflation, which felt terrible but was still navigable. You got a job, maybe went to graduate school (which was affordable), started a career. Vietnam ended. Watergate happened. Disco rose and fell. You probably got married, bought a house, maybe started having kids. The American Dream was available, with effort, and you were making the effort.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1984-1994):</strong> Reagan and then Bush. The Cold War ended with a whimper instead of a bang. The Berlin Wall fell when you were thirty-five. You were hitting your professional stride, getting promoted, accumulating responsibilities. Your kids were in school. Your mortgage was getting paid down. The stock market was rewarding your 401(k). Life was working according to plan.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1994-2004):</strong> Clinton, Lewinsky, impeachment theater. The internet went from academic curiosity to mainstream obsession. The dot-com bubble inflated and burst. Your kids were teenagers, which brought new challenges. Y2K was overblown. 9/11 was not. You were fifty when the towers fell, old enough to remember other national traumas, young enough to have decades of aftermath ahead. This decade reshaped your worldview, again.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2004-2014):</strong> Bush, Obama. Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2008 financial crisis wiped out retirement accounts and reminded everyone that markets go down, too. But you had time to recover, and you probably did. Your kids graduated college, maybe got married. You started thinking about retirement as a real thing rather than an abstract concept. The age of grandchildren began.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2014-2024):</strong> You watched younger generations struggle with economics that would have been unrecognizable when you were their age. You retired, or thought about retiring, or realized retirement wasn't quite what you'd planned. Health became more of a preoccupation. Parents died, if they hadn't already. The world accelerated—smartphones, social media, political polarization—and you had to decide how much to keep up with.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2024+):</strong> You're here now or approaching. The actuarial tables say you have good odds of reaching eighty-five or ninety, especially if you're relatively healthy. But longevity creates its own challenges—outliving savings, outliving friends, watching the world become less familiar. Your generation will be the last to remember the postwar boom from the inside. What you carry—the memories, the perspective, the sense of how different things once were—will disappear with you.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4 million people born in 1954. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US, which was the largest generation in American history until Millennials exceeded it. You are, by the numbers, the demographic pig in the python—a bulge that's moved through every life stage and reshaped institutions as it went.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you're louder, more politically engaged, and far more willing to challenge authority. They kept their heads down. You raised yours. They built the institutions. You questioned them—then ran them, then defended them against the next generation's questioning.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more optimistic and more numerous. Gen X got overshadowed by your cohort and responded with ironic detachment. They watched you dominate the culture and decided not to compete for attention. They're the middle children of history, too small to move the needle but old enough to remember when you did.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is obscene. You controlled 21% of the nation's wealth when you were in your thirties. Millennials controlled 3% at the same age. You bought houses for three years' salary. They're paying ten years' salary. You had pensions. They have anxiety. This isn't entirely your fault, but it is the inheritance you're leaving.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're practically from a different planet. They've never known a world without the internet, smartphones, or school shooting drills. They have no memory of the pre-9/11 world. The stability you took for granted is mythology to them. You changed the world once. They're trying to survive the one you left.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 69 years. If you've made it to 70, actuarial tables give you good odds of reaching 85+. You're part of the longest-lived generation in human history, which creates challenges—healthcare costs, retirement funding, the slow accumulation of loss as friends and siblings die. Longevity is a gift that comes with difficult terms and conditions.</p>"
