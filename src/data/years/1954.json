      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1954-1966</h2><p>The smell of Crayola crayons and paste from a jar with a rubber spreader. The heft of Lincoln Logs tumbling from a cardboard canister. The satisfying snap of Tinker Toys connecting. Your childhood was tactile in ways that feel almost archaeological now—everything had weight, texture, a physical presence that demanded you show up.</p><p>At three, you were watching Howdy Doody with forty other kids crammed into the Peanut Gallery, wondering if Clarabell would ever actually speak. By five, Captain Kangaroo was your morning ritual—Mr. Green Jeans, Bunny Rabbit stealing carrots, Grandfather Clock that never quite kept time. Kukla, Fran and Ollie for the intellectual kids. Romper Room for the ones who needed Miss Nancy to see them through that magic mirror. (She never called your name. Nobody's did, but you kept watching anyway.)</p><p>Your Saturday mornings were sacred. Mickey Mouse Club after school—Annette Funicello was every boy's first crush, though you didn't have words for it yet. You knew all the Mouseketeers by name. You had the ears. You probably still have the ears somewhere, in a box your kids will throw away when you're gone.</p><p>The Davy Crockett craze hit when you were one, but you caught the tail end—coonskin caps everywhere, 'The Ballad of Davy Crockett' playing from every radio, Disney selling frontier nostalgia to suburban kids who'd never see Tennessee. By five, you wanted a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, like the kid in every department store catalog. Your mother said you'd shoot your eye out.</p><p>Food was simpler and stranger. TV dinners in their aluminum trays—Swanson turkey with the little compartments, eaten in front of the television because that was the whole point. Tang, the drink astronauts would eventually take to space, though you drank it first. Wonder Bread that built strong bodies twelve ways. Jiffy Pop on the stove, watching the foil dome inflate like magic. Twinkies and Hostess CupCakes with that little squiggle of frosting. Your parents remembered rationing. You got Kool-Aid in five flavors.</p><p>At nine, President Kennedy was killed in Dallas. November 22, 1963. You were in fourth grade. A teacher cried. The principal came on the intercom. They sent you home early, and your mother was already watching it on television, and you watched her watch it, and you understood that something had broken. The funeral procession. John-John saluting. Walter Cronkite removing his glasses. You didn't fully understand what you'd lost, but you knew you'd lost something. The country knew it too.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The name itself sounds like an explosion, which is appropriate—<span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> of you, born in the eighteen years after World War II, the largest generation in American history until Millennials finally caught up. Your parents came home from war, got busy, and created a demographic tsunami that reshaped every institution it touched.</p><p>You were three when Sputnik launched and the space race began. Five when Barbie debuted, teaching girls that impossible proportions were aspirational. Nine when JFK was assassinated. Ten when the Beatles landed on Ed Sullivan and changed everything about what American teenagers wanted to be. Fifteen when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon—you probably stayed up late, watching that grainy footage, knowing you were seeing history.</p><p>At twenty-one, the Vietnam War finally ended. You were draft-eligible. <span class=\"pull-quote\">You either went, or knew someone who went, or protested going, or found ways not to go. Every Boomer man had to make that calculation. Every Boomer woman watched men she knew make it.</span> The war defined your generation more than any other event—not because everyone agreed about it, but because nobody could avoid it. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p><p>Your generation invented the concept of youth culture as a market category. Before you, teenagers were adults-in-waiting, dressed like smaller versions of their parents. You demanded your own music (rock and roll, then folk, then psychedelic, then disco), your own fashion (bell bottoms, tie-dye, leisure suits), your own politics (civil rights, anti-war, women's lib). You weren't content to inherit the world. You wanted to remake it.</p><p>Boomers are sandwiched between the Silent Generation—who came of age during Depression and war and learned to keep their heads down—and Gen X, who watched you dominate every room and decided the whole game was rigged anyway. You're idealistic enough to believe you changed the world. You're pragmatic enough to have eventually joined the institutions you once protested. Both things are true. That's the Boomer condition.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>On the Waterfront won Best Picture the year you were born—Marlon Brando in that taxi, 'I coulda been a contender' entering the language forever. But you were too young for Brando. Your first movie memories were Disney: Cinderella on re-release, Lady and the Tramp when you were one, Sleeping Beauty at five. Old Yeller when you were three, which is still too young to process that ending.</p><p>Television was becoming America's living room furniture. Your house probably got its first set when you were a toddler—a Philco or RCA console with a tiny screen and rabbit ear antennas that someone was always adjusting. Father Knows Best premiered when you were born. I Love Lucy was already a hit. The Disneyland anthology show started that year, training you to want to visit a theme park that wouldn't open until you were one.</p><p>Rock and roll was being born in parallel with you. Bill Haley recorded 'Rock Around the Clock' in 1954, though it wouldn't become a phenomenon until Blackboard Jungle a year later. Elvis was still driving a truck in Memphis, a year away from 'That's All Right.' You were too young to understand the revolution, but you grew up inside it. By the time you were six, Elvis was on Ed Sullivan from the waist up, and rock and roll had won.</p><p>The British Invasion hit when you were ten. February 9, 1964—73 million Americans watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. You were one of them, probably in your pajamas, not fully understanding why your older sister was screaming. Within months, you knew every word to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' Within years, you'd argue about whether John or Paul was better. (The correct answer is George, but you wouldn't figure that out until later.)</p><p>Your teenage years were a soundtrack. Motown: Supremes, Temptations, Marvin Gaye. British rock: the Stones, the Who, the Kinks. American response: Beach Boys harmonizing about a California you'd probably never visit. Bob Dylan going electric at Newport and half the crowd booing. The Monterey Pop Festival when you were thirteen. Woodstock when you were fifteen—half a million people in a field, mud and music and the feeling that everything was possible. You were probably too young to go. You definitely knew someone who claimed they did.</p><p>The pop culture of your childhood was communal in a way that doesn't exist anymore. Three networks. One radio dial. Everyone watched the same shows, heard the same songs, argued about the same movies. There was no algorithm sorting you into niches. Popular culture was actually popular—shared, debated, experienced together in real time.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The transistor radio was born the same year you were. Texas Instruments built the Regency TR-1, the first commercial portable radio, and suddenly music could follow you anywhere. You probably got one as a teenager, pressed it against your ear at night, listening to stations that faded in and out depending on the weather. The AM dial was your algorithm.</p><p>Your parents probably watched your first steps on a Bell & Howell 8mm camera—film that had to be sent away for processing, then threaded through a projector, then watched in darkened rooms while the machine clattered. Home movies were events, not casual documentation. The footage was precious because it was expensive.</p><p>Color television existed when you were born, but nobody you knew had one. Your family probably got a color set in the mid-sixties, and it was furniture—a wooden console that dominated the living room, with a screen that took thirty seconds to warm up. The first thing you watched in color was probably Bonanza, the whole point of which seemed to be showing off that the network had color. The Ponderosa never looked so green.</p><p>You were nineteen when ARPANET sent its first message—'LO' (the system crashed before 'LOGIN' could complete). You didn't know it then, but you were watching the birth of the internet. At twenty-one, Intel created the first microprocessor. At thirty, IBM introduced the personal computer, and your office probably got one within five years. At forty-one, the World Wide Web went public, and everything you thought you knew about information changed.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is that of a translator. You're fluent in both the analog and digital worlds. You can read a paper map and use GPS. You can write a letter by hand and send an email. You remember when long-distance calls were expensive, when photographs required film, when being unreachable was normal. You've watched three generations learn to use devices that didn't exist when you were their age, and you've adapted alongside them—slower, maybe, but adapting.</p><p>You remember what boredom felt like. Real boredom, with nothing to fill it but your own thoughts. No phone in your pocket. No infinite scroll. Just you and time, passing slowly, forcing you to invent your own entertainment. Kids today will never know that emptiness. You're not sure if they're lucky or deprived.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Brown v. Board of Education was decided the year you were born—May 17, 1954. The Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools were inherently unequal, though it would take another decade of marches, bombings, and federal troops before that ruling meant anything in most Southern schools. You were born into the legal end of Jim Crow. You came of age during the violent death throes of its enforcement.</p><p>You were three when Sputnik launched—October 4, 1957. A beeping Soviet satellite, the size of a beach ball, orbiting overhead, proving the Russians could put something in space and, therefore, could put something on your house. Your parents were terrified. You were too young to understand, but you absorbed the anxiety. Space became a national obsession. You'd grow up wanting to be an astronaut, or knowing someone who did.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At nine, Kennedy was assassinated—November 22, 1963. Where were you when you heard?</span> The historical aftermath unfolded rapidly: the Warren Commission, the escalation in Vietnam, and the cascade of events that would transform the 1960s from optimism into upheaval.</p><p>At ten, the Beatles landed. At fourteen, Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were killed within two months of each other. At fifteen, you watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon—July 20, 1969. 'One small step for man.' Your family probably gathered around the television, and for a moment, the country felt unified in wonder. It wouldn't last, but you remember how it felt.</p><p>Vietnam was the constant background noise of your adolescence. The draft lottery started when you were fifteen. <span class=\"pull-quote\">If you were male, you knew your number—the birthday that determined whether you'd be called.</span> The war ended when you were twenty-one, having consumed your entire teenage years, having killed <span class=\"stat-box\">58,000</span> Americans and millions of Vietnamese, having divided families and ended friendships and taught your generation that the government could lie, spectacularly and repeatedly, about matters of life and death.</p><p>At twenty, Nixon resigned. Watergate proved that the system could hold a president accountable—or proved that it took this long to do so, depending on your perspective. At thirty-five, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Cold War that had defined your childhood ended with a whimper instead of the nuclear apocalypse everyone had feared. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> The world you'd spent decades building became something else entirely. Again.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about the deal you were offered, and how it compared to what came after.</p><p>You entered the workforce around 1976, give or take. The economy wasn't great—oil crisis, stagflation, malaise. But here's what was still true: jobs came with pensions. Health insurance was part of the package, not a line item that ate half your raise. Loyalty was a two-way contract. You gave the company your career, and the company gave you security.</p><p>Your parents' path looked like this: graduate, get hired, work forty years at the same company, get a pension, retire with a gold watch and a party. Your path was similar, with options: maybe switch jobs once or twice, but always with the reasonable expectation that the next job would also offer stability, benefits, a ladder that led somewhere.</p><p>You probably worked harder than your parents did. The hours got longer through the eighties. The 'work-life balance' phrase was invented because balance was disappearing. You brought work home. You skipped vacations. You proved your commitment through presence, through sacrifice, through being the first one in and the last one out.</p><p>And it worked. For you. You climbed the ladder because the ladder existed. You accumulated wealth because the economy was designed to let middle-class people accumulate wealth. You hit your peak earning years during the longest bull market in history. Your 401(k) grew while you slept. Your house appreciated while you mowed the lawn.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and you watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> Here's the uncomfortable truth: the deal you got isn't the deal that exists anymore. The companies that rewarded your loyalty now treat employees as replaceable inputs. The pensions are gone. The job security is gone. The path from mailroom to corner office is gone. <span class=\"pull-quote\">You made it through the door before it closed, and watching you succeed on a path that no longer exists drives younger workers quietly insane.</span></p><p>You're not wrong that you worked hard. You're incomplete if you think hard work alone explains your success. Timing mattered. The economy mattered. The social contract that no longer exists—that mattered most of all.</p>"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Did you ever sit by the phone, physically sit there, waiting for someone to call? The phone was attached to the wall by a cord. You couldn't take it with you. If you wanted to know whether they'd called, you had to be home. And if they called while you weren't home, you'd never know. No voicemail, no missed call notification. Just silence, and wondering.</p><p>Dating in your era required courage that technology has made optional. Asking someone out meant doing it in person, or on the phone with their parents possibly listening. Rejection happened to your face. You couldn't swipe left. You couldn't ghost. You had to show up, be vulnerable, risk humiliation in real time.</p><p>Long-distance relationships meant actual distance. Long-distance phone calls cost money—real money, billed by the minute. You wrote letters instead. Actual letters, on paper, with stamps. You waited days for replies. The anticipation was part of the romance. The delay created space for imagination, for longing, for feelings to build that instant communication might have flattened.</p><p>You probably married younger than Millennials will. The average age at first marriage for your generation was early twenties. Your parents' generation was even younger—wartime marriages, starter homes, babies by twenty-five. You followed the script, maybe with a few detours. Divorce was still scandalous when you were young, then suddenly it was everywhere. Your generation normalized ending marriages that previous generations would have endured in resentful silence.</p><p>You raised kids during the latchkey era, when both parents working became normal and no one had invented 'helicopter parenting' yet. Your children had house keys on strings around their necks. They came home to empty houses, made their own snacks, watched television until you got home from work. They had more freedom and less supervision than any generation before or since. They turned out fine, mostly, and the guilt you felt about working is probably excessive.</p><p>Your friendships are different from younger generations' friendships. You know people's phone numbers by heart—fewer than you used to, but some. You've maintained relationships for fifty years, through moves and marriages and divorces and deaths. You've lost friends to cancer and heart attacks and car accidents, and you've learned that friendship, in the long run, requires showing up for funerals.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Here are some numbers that explain why younger people look at you with a mixture of envy and frustration.</p><p>A house in 1976, when you were entering the workforce, cost about <span class=\"stat-box\">$44,000</span> on average. The median household income was about <span class=\"stat-box\">$13,000</span>. That's a ratio of roughly 3.4—a house cost 3.4 years of income. Today, the median house costs over <span class=\"stat-box\">$400,000</span>. The median household income is about <span class=\"stat-box\">$75,000</span>. That's a ratio of 5.3, and in many cities it's 8, 10, or higher. <span class=\"hero-callout\">The math that worked for you doesn't work anymore.</span></p><p>College tuition in 1976 averaged about <span class=\"stat-box\">$2,500 per year</span> at a four-year public university. You could pay that with a summer job. Today, the average is over <span class=\"stat-box\">$25,000 per year</span>, and that's before room and board. <span class=\"pull-quote\">A summer job covers approximately one month. The degree your kids need to compete costs more than your first house did.</span></p><p>Your financial journey unfolded during specific economic conditions. Housing was accessible at purchase prices that made sense relative to income. Educational costs were manageable. Markets rewarded patience over decades. The arithmetic of middle-class wealth building still functioned. These weren't universal conditions—they were the conditions of your era.</p><p>Your relationship with money was shaped by parents who remembered the Depression. They taught you to save, to avoid debt, to be suspicious of credit. You probably carried those lessons into adulthood, which served you well. You bought things you could afford. You paid off your mortgage. You contributed to retirement accounts during the longest bull market in history and watched your net worth climb.</p><p>Your current financial concerns center on preservation rather than accumulation. Healthcare costs that can consume decades of savings. Long-term care expenses that exceed most retirement projections. The calculation of how much you need versus how long you'll need it. These are different problems than building wealth, but problems nonetheless.</p><p>The money you accumulated came through consistent effort applied over time—showing up, saving, investing, waiting. The formula worked. Whether it works the same way for subsequent generations depends on conditions beyond any individual's control.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation changed the world, and then stopped believing the world needed further changing. You marched for civil rights and women's rights and against the war, and then you got tired, got jobs, got mortgages, and decided the revolution was complete. It wasn't. It never is.</p><p>The instinct to universalize personal experience is human, not generational. You worked hard and succeeded, so hard work must cause success. The logic feels sound because it matched your experience. Recognizing that correlation isn't causation—that conditions mattered as much as effort—requires stepping outside the story you've told yourself for decades.</p><p>Advice becomes outdated faster than anyone expects. The pathways you navigated have been restructured, rerouted, or closed entirely. Your experience remains valid as history, less valid as prescription. The gap between those two roles is where generational misunderstanding lives.</p><p>You've held political power longer than any generation should. The average age of Congressional leadership keeps climbing. The same faces—your faces—have dominated politics for decades. You changed everything when you were young, then defended the institutions you created against the next wave of change. This is the cycle of all generations, but awareness of the cycle might help you step aside more gracefully.</p><p>Some of you have struggled with cultural shifts that emerged after your formative years. The conversations around gender, sexuality, race, and identity that have accelerated since 2010 can feel like too much, too fast. You moved the needle enormously on the issues of your youth. The issues of your grandchildren's youth are different, and the needle moves differently. Discomfort is understandable. Dismissal is a choice.</p><p>Your generation normalized work as identity. You sacrificed for the company, and the company rewarded you. Younger people watched that contract get shredded and decided not to sign it. When they prioritize life over work, they're not lazy—they're rational actors responding to different incentives. The deal changed. Their response to it is logical, even if it looks foreign to you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1974-1984):</strong> You entered adulthood during oil crises and stagflation, which felt terrible but was still navigable. Jobs existed. Pensions existed. Health insurance came with employment. You could afford rent on an entry-level salary, even if you complained about it. You got married—earlier than your kids would, probably earlier than you'd recommend now. You might have had kids by thirty. The American Dream was available with effort, and you were making the effort.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1984-1994):</strong> Reagan's morning in America. The Cold War winding down. You were hitting your stride—promotions, raises, responsibilities. Your kids were in elementary school. Your mortgage was getting paid down. The stock market rewarded every dollar you invested. Life was working according to plan. By thirty-five, the Berlin Wall fell, and the existential threat your childhood was organized around simply evaporated. You weren't sure what came next. Neither was anyone else.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1994-2004):</strong> Clinton's boom years and then Bush's war years. The internet went from curiosity to necessity. The dot-com bubble inflated and burst. Your kids were teenagers, which meant new anxieties, new expenses, new negotiations about curfews and cars. 9/11 happened when you were forty-seven—old enough to remember other national traumas, young enough to have decades of aftermath ahead. The world you'd built your life in was reshaping, again.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2004-2014):</strong> Peak earning years, or close to it. The 2008 financial crisis wiped out retirement accounts, but you had time to recover, and you probably did. Your kids graduated college, got married, maybe started giving you grandchildren. You started thinking about retirement as a real thing—not abstract, not someday, but soon. You noticed you were becoming the older generation in rooms that used to belong to you.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2014-2024):</strong> Retirement, or the approach to it. Some of you stopped working; some of you couldn't afford to; some of you didn't want to. Health became a larger consideration—checkups, medications, procedures that your parents' generation didn't live long enough to need. You watched your children struggle with economics that would have been unrecognizable when you were their age. You tried to help, if you could. You worried, either way.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2024+):</strong> You're here now, or you're approaching. The actuarial tables give you good odds of reaching eighty-five, ninety, beyond—longer than any generation in human history. But longevity comes with challenges: outliving savings, outliving friends, outliving the world you recognize. Your generation will be the last to remember the postwar boom from the inside, the last to know what it felt like before everything was connected, before screens were everywhere, before the future felt uncertain. What you carry—the memory of that stability, real or imagined—will disappear with you.</p>"

You're part of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Baby Boomers, the demographic wave that reshaped every institution it touched—schools in the sixties, universities in the seventies, workplaces in the eighties and nineties, and now healthcare systems straining to serve your needs.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They learned to keep their heads down during Depression and war. You learned to raise your voice. They built institutions carefully, brick by brick. You challenged those institutions, sometimes tearing them down, sometimes rebuilding them in your image. They trusted authority. You questioned it—then became it, and expected trust from younger generations who inherited your skepticism.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They're the middle children, sandwiched between your massive cohort and Millennials' even larger one. They watched you dominate every room—classrooms, boardrooms, living rooms—and responded with ironic detachment. They don't believe they can change the world the way you believed it. They don't believe the institutions you reformed will work for them. They were the first latchkey kids, and something about that shaped their independence and their pessimism.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap tells the story.</span> When Boomers were in their forties, your generation controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials at the same age control 7%. You bought houses for three years' salary. They're looking at six to ten times theirs, depending on the market. You had pensions and employer healthcare. They have student debt and 401(k)s they manage themselves. Different starting conditions produce different outcomes.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They've never known a world without the internet, school shooting drills, or climate anxiety. The stability you took for granted is mythology to them. They don't expect Social Security to exist when they're old. They don't expect to buy houses or have pensions or retire at sixty-five. They're not cynical—they're calibrated to a world of diminishing expectations. The optimism that defined your generation looks naive to them. They might be right.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Your generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Your life expectancy at birth was about sixty-nine years. If you've made it to seventy, actuarial tables give you strong odds of reaching eighty-five or beyond. You're part of the longest-lived generation in human history, which creates its own challenges—healthcare costs, retirement funding, the slow accumulation of loss as friends and siblings die. You changed the world in ways that will outlive you. Whether the next generations thank you for it remains to be seen.</p>"
