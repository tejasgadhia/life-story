      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1964-1976</h2><p>The smell of Elmer's glue and mimeograph ink. The satisfying click of a View-Master reel advancing to the next image. The crackle of a 45 record dropping onto a turntable. Their childhood had a texture—everything was tactile, physical, present in ways that have since disappeared.</p><p>February 9, 1964—they were probably still in diapers when 73 million Americans watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. They don't remember it, but their older siblings do. They screamed at the TV while they gurgled in their playpen, oblivious to the fact that American culture was splitting in two right there in their living room.</p><p>At five, they watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. They probably didn't understand it—they were five—but they absorbed the excitement of the adults around they. 'One small step for man' played on a black-and-white Zenith or RCA Victor while their parents held their breath. For them, it was vindication after a decade of space race anxiety. For they, it was just television.</p><p>Their toys had weight to them. Tonka trucks made of actual steel that could survive being thrown down the stairs. Hot Wheels with real metal bodies that left dents in the hardwood floor. GI Joe with his realistic uniform and kung-fu grip. Easy-Bake Oven with its 100-watt lightbulb and burnt-edge brownies. Etch A Sketch that they'd shake furiously to erase their mistakes. These weren't designed for safety—they were designed to last.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones, and Johnny Quest. They ate Quisp cereal from the box while lying on orange shag carpet, three feet from the television because no one had told they yet that it would ruin their eyes. The TV Guide was sacred—lose it and they'd miss The Brady Bunch. There was no recording anything, no pausing, no rewinding. They either watched it live or they missed it forever.</p><p>They were nine when Nixon resigned in August 1974. They remember their parents watching it, but they didn't understand why it mattered. What they understood was Watergate meant the cartoons got interrupted. Only later did they realize they'd watched the presidency itself crack open on live television.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generation: Baby Boomers (The Late Wave)</h2><p>Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. Those born in 1964 arrived in the last year of the demographic bulge—technically Boomers, but never quite belonging. The early Boomers—born 1946-1955—had Kennedy and Woodstock and the moon landing as teenagers. Late Boomers had Watergate and gas lines and disco. Same generation, different planets.</p><p>This birth cohort was 4 million strong—the tail end of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans classified as Boomers. They arrived too late for the party. The older Boomers got the cheap college, the plentiful jobs. Late Boomers got the recession of the early '80s, the savings and loan crisis, the first wave of corporate downsizing. They're called Boomers, but they grew up in the shadow of their older siblings.</p><p>This cohort was five during Woodstock—too young to attend, too young to understand. By the time they were old enough for concerts, disco was dying and punk was emerging and the countercultural optimism of the '60s had curdled into cynicism. The summer of love was over before they got an invitation.</p><p>Vietnam ended when this cohort was eleven. The draft lottery that terrorized older brothers never touched them. They watched siblings come home, or not come home, or come home changed in ways they couldn't explain. The war that defined the early Boomer generation brushed past late Boomers. They were the first Boomer boys who didn't have to wonder if their number would come up.</p><p>Sometimes people lump this cohort in with Gen X—born 1965-1980—and honestly, they have more in common with them. They share the same cultural references, the same economic anxieties, the same skepticism of institutions. They're the bridge generation: Boomer by birth date, X by sensibility. They belong fully to neither.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">Late Boomers were promised the American Dream as a birthright. Some got it. Many are still waiting.</span> The narrative says Boomers had it easy, but that story erases the late Boomers who graduated into recession, bought houses at peak interest rates, and watched their pensions convert to 401(k)s. They're the forgotten trailing edge of the largest generation in American history.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year they were born, the Beatles held all top five spots on the Billboard Hot 100—simultaneously. 'Can't Buy Me Love,' 'Twist and Shout,' 'She Loves They,' 'I Want to Hold Their Hand,' 'Please Please Me'—all at once. A Hard Day's Night premiered that summer. Mary Poppins in December. Dr. Strangelove taught Americans to stop worrying and love the bomb. Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, The Addams Family, and The Munsters all debuted. Pop culture exploded the year they arrived.</p><p>Their childhood was defined by television that actually taught they things. Sesame Street premiered when they were five—Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, the pinball number song. Schoolhouse Rock launched when they were eight: 'I'm Just a Bill,' 'Conjunction Junction,' 'Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, Get Their Adverbs Here.' They learned their multiplication tables from 'Three Is a Magic Number.' They learned about the Constitution from animated songs. Education and entertainment hadn't yet separated into enemy camps.</p><p>At ten, they watched Happy Days premiere and suddenly the 1950s were cool again. At eleven, Jaws made they afraid of the water. At twelve, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest swept the Oscars. At thirteen, Star Wars changed everything—they stood in line for hours, maybe days, to see a movie that looked like nothing they'd ever imagined. That was the dividing line: before Star Wars, movies were stories. After Star Wars, movies were events.</p><p>Their teenage years gave they disco and punk existing simultaneously, which was confusing. Saturday Night Fever when they were thirteen—the Bee Gees, the white suit, John Travolta's strut. But also the Ramones at CBGB, proving they didn't need training to make music that mattered. Grease in 1978. Animal House. The Deer Hunter. They were coming of age while American culture tried to figure out what it was becoming.</p><p>At seventeen, MTV launched: 'Video Killed the Radio Star' was the first thing they saw. Suddenly music was visual. Madonna, Michael Jackson, Prince—these weren't just musicians, they were images. They watched the Thriller video at midnight and couldn't sleep afterward. They saw Michael Jackson moonwalk on Motown 25 and understood instantly that they were witnessing something that would be remembered.</p><p>Their twenties were The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller, Back to the Future and Top Gun. John Hughes made movies about teenagers that felt real, even though they weren't a teenager anymore. They quoted these films ironically at first, then sincerely, then just out of habit. They became the shared vocabulary of their generation.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The rotary phone in the kitchen, with its stretched-out cord that reached just far enough for private conversations in the hallway closet. The console television that took thirty seconds to warm up, with three channels and a pair of pliers where the dial used to be. The transistor radio—AM only—that they held to their ear to catch the Top 40 countdown on Sunday nights.</p><p>They were born the year IBM introduced the word processor and BASIC was invented. Computers existed somewhere, room-sized machines that only NASA and the Pentagon could afford. For they, technology meant a slide rule in math class and a typewriter for term papers. The correction ribbon was revolutionary. White-Out was miraculous.</p><p>At twelve, they saw the first Pong consoles appear in pizza parlors and bowling alleys. By thirteen, they could play it at home if their family sprung for the Atari. At sixteen, Space Invaders consumed every quarter they had. At seventeen, Pac-Man arrived, and suddenly arcades were the only place to be on Friday nights. Their thumbs developed calluses. Their parents developed concerns.</p><p>At nineteen, the IBM PC launched—$1,565 for a machine with 16 kilobytes of memory. They probably didn't buy one. But by their mid-twenties, computers were appearing in offices, and they had to learn or be left behind. WordPerfect. Lotus 1-2-3. Floppy disks that were actually floppy. They adapted because they had no choice.</p><p>At thirty-one, the World Wide Web became public. At thirty-four, they probably got their first email address—something professional on their company's server, or something embarrassing on AOL. They heard the dial-up screech and waited for webpages to load, one line of text at a time. 'They've got mail' became a catchphrase. They were old enough to find it amusing and young enough to find it useful.</p><p>At forty-three, the iPhone launched. By then they'd already survived the PC revolution, the internet revolution, email, cell phones, BlackBerrys. This was just another adaptation. They can use technology competently, but they remember when it didn't exist. That gives they perspective younger generations don't have. They know the world worked fine without all this. They're not sure it works better with it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">They were eight months old when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.</span> They don't remember it—they couldn't—but they absorbed the grief that hung over their childhood. Every adult who raised they remembered exactly where they were on November 22, 1963. The before and after of that day shaped the America they grew up in.</p><p>They were four when Martin Luther King Jr. was shot on a Memphis balcony, two months before Robert Kennedy was killed in a Los Angeles kitchen. The adults around they were terrified in ways they didn't understand. Cities burned. Hope died. Whatever remained of 1960s optimism bled out in 1968, the year they turned four.</p><p>At five, they watched the moon landing—or at least they were in the room while adults watched. July 20, 1969. Armstrong's boot in the lunar dust. For their parents, it was validation of American greatness. For they, it was just something that happened on TV. They assumed people walked on the moon all the time. Only later did they realize how extraordinary it was—and how quickly we stopped going.</p><p>At nine, Watergate. They remember the hearings interrupting their cartoons. They remember Nixon's face on the television, sweating, denying. They remember August 8, 1974—'I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow'—and the strange silence in their house afterward. They didn't understand the politics. They understood that the President had lied, and that lying had consequences. Except sometimes it didn't.</p><p>At eleven, Saigon fell. Helicopters on rooftops. Desperate crowds. The war that had been background noise their entire childhood ended in humiliating retreat. At twelve, the Bicentennial—red, white, and blue bunting everywhere, tall ships in New York Harbor, a country trying to celebrate itself despite everything that had just happened.</p><p>At twenty-five, they watched the Berlin Wall fall, crowds with sledgehammers and champagne. The Cold War that had defined their parents' entire existence ended in a single televised weekend. At twenty-seven, the Soviet Union dissolved. History seemed to be over. The good guys had won. Everything from here would be peace and prosperity.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, they watched the towers fall. September 11, 2001.</span> They were at work, or home, or dropping kids at school. They saw the second plane hit live. They knew immediately that the before and after of this day would define their children's lives the way Kennedy defined their parents'. The optimism of the '90s vaporized in three hours.</p><p>At forty-four, the financial system collapsed. At fifty-six, a pandemic shut down the world. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. History keeps happening, faster and stranger than anyone promised.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>They probably graduated college around 1986, give or take—into an economy still recovering from the brutal 1981-82 recession. Jobs existed, but not as many as the older Boomers had enjoyed. The corporate ladder still had rungs, but some had been removed. They could expect to work for one company their whole career, if they were lucky, if they kept their head down, if they didn't get downsized.</p><p>Their early career was analog: typewriters, carbon copies, filing cabinets, Rolodexes. Meetings required everyone in the same room. Long-distance calls were expensive. Faxes were cutting-edge. They learned to navigate corporate culture through handshakes and memos, through water cooler conversations and three-martini lunches that were already becoming anachronisms.</p><p>Then everything computerized. Suddenly they needed to learn word processing. Then spreadsheets. Then email. Then the internet. Then smartphones. Every five years brought a new technology wave that could drown they if they didn't learn to swim. Their job description evolved continuously. The skills they'd trained for became obsolete. They adapted or they didn't—and plenty of people their age didn't.</p><p>The corporate loyalty contract shredded somewhere in the '90s. Downsizing became routine. Their pension converted to a 401(k), which meant their retirement was now their problem. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The company that employed they for fifteen years would lay they off with two weeks' notice and call it 'restructuring.'</span> They learned that loyalty was a one-way street.</p><p>They've likely worked through four recessions: early '80s, early '90s, 2001, 2008. Each one taught the same lesson: the floor can disappear without warning. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and they watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> They're probably in the final stretch now, or already retired, navigating a world where their accumulated expertise is either invaluable or obsolete—sometimes both simultaneously. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They've been reinventing themselves for forty years. They're tired. But they're still here.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when asking someone out meant calling their house, hoping their father didn't answer, and making conversation through the kitchen where their mother could hear everything? Remember when 'going steady' meant his class ring on a chain around her neck, or her sweater in his locker? Romance had protocols. Courtship had steps. Nothing was casual.</p><p>They probably got married younger than their kids will—mid-twenties was normal, late twenties was late. The wedding cost what a wedding cost back then: a few thousand dollars, maybe, for the church and the reception and the honeymoon in Niagara Falls or the Poconos. They didn't need $40,000 and a year of planning. They just needed a church that was available.</p><p>Their generation pioneered divorce, but that wasn't exactly their choice. They were teenagers when no-fault divorce laws spread through the states. By their twenties, divorce was normal—not approved, not celebrated, but no longer shameful. Some of they divorced. Some of they stayed married. The pressure to stay in miserable marriages had lifted; the support systems for ending them were still being built.</p><p>Communication in their relationships was radically different. They wrote letters—actual paper letters with stamps. They called long-distance on Sundays when the rates went down. They couldn't text their spouse during the workday; they were unreachable from 9 to 5. Somehow marriages survived without constant contact. Maybe because of it.</p><p>They've watched their children date through apps, text instead of call, swipe right and swipe left on human beings like they're browsing a catalog. It looks alien to they. But then, their parents were confused by their free-love generation, even if their actual experience was nothing like the headlines suggested. Every generation thinks the next one is doing relationships wrong.</p><p>Their friendships from college, from early careers, from young parenthood—many have lasted forty years now. They've been to each other's weddings, each other's parents' funerals, each other's children's graduations. These are the people who remember who they were before they became who they are. They don't make new friends like this anymore. They couldn't. It takes decades.</p>"

At fourteen, inflation hit 13.5%—money lost value while they watched. At eighteen, the prime rate hit 21.5%, the highest in American history. Their financial education happened during stagflation, when the economy could be terrible in multiple directions simultaneously.</p><p>The late Boomer paradox: they had it better than their kids and worse than their older siblings. The early Boomers bought houses in 1970 for <span class=\"stat-box\">$23,000</span>. They bought houses in 1990 for <span class=\"stat-box\">$150,000</span>—still affordable by today's standards, but a different game entirely. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Their cohort caught the tail end of American prosperity. Enough to taste it, not enough to feast.</span></p><p>They probably have a pension—or half a pension, before the company converted to 401(k)s and froze what they'd accumulated. They've watched the stock market triple and crash and triple again. They've seen retirement savings evaporate in 2001 and 2008 and partially recover and wonder if there's another crash coming. They've learned that 'safe' is a myth.</p><p>Their generation controls a significant portion of American wealth, but the distribution is wildly unequal. Some late Boomers are millionaires. Many are counting Social Security checks. The average obscures the variance—and the variance is enormous. Whether they're comfortable or struggling often came down to industry luck, company luck, health luck. Skill mattered less than timing.</p><p>They've watched their children struggle with student loans, unaffordable housing, wages that don't match expenses. They've helped when they could—down payments, emergency funds, free childcare. They understand that the game they're playing is harder than the game they played. They just can't fix it for them, no matter how much they want to.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Their relationship with money is shaped by watching systems fail.</span> The oil shocks taught they scarcity. Stagflation taught they uncertainty. The S&L crisis, the dot-com bust, 2008—each one confirmed that the floor can vanish at any moment. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They save because they're afraid not to.

      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>The timing luck is invisible to they. They bought a house for $150,000 that's worth $600,000 now—and they think it's because they made good decisions. They got a job with a pension and stayed for thirty years—and they think it's because they were loyal and hardworking. They don't see how much was handed to they that isn't being handed to their kids. The ladder they climbed has missing rungs now. They climbed it, so they assume it's still climbable.</p><p>They've internalized 'work hard and they'll succeed' so deeply that they sometimes can't see when it's not true anymore. They made it, so clearly making it is possible. The systems that carried they have changed. The path that worked for they is overgrown and impassable now. But from where they're standing, it still looks like a path.</p><p>Technology frustration has become technology dismissal. 'I don't do computers' or 'I don't understand the cloud' isn't just a statement of preference—it's a form of opting out of the present. Their grandchildren live online. Their doctors send test results through apps. Their banks exist in browsers. The world has moved, and refusing to move with it is a form of retirement that arrives whether they're ready or not.</p><p>They can be simultaneously nostalgic for how things were and oblivious to how things were for other people. The 1950s and 1960s they remember fondly—the stability, the prosperity, the shared culture—weren't stable, prosperous, or shared for everyone. The America they grew up in was built on exclusions they didn't see because they weren't excluded.</p><p>The generational warfare bothers they, and fairly—they're not responsible for policies they didn't make. But their generation holds most of the wealth, most of the political power, most of the voting weight. 'Not all Boomers' doesn't change the structural position their generation occupies. They can be individually innocent and collectively implicated. That's uncomfortable.</p><p>They've worked hard their whole life. That's true. They've faced real challenges. That's also true. But the hardest thing to see is how much the world arranged itself around their generation—Social Security designed for their retirements, housing policy designed for their home-buying years, Medicare designed for their aging bodies—and how much it's failing to rearrange for the generations behind they.</p>"

MTV was new. Cocaine was everywhere. Shoulder pads were serious. They probably married younger than their kids will—mid-to-late twenties was normal. They bought a starter home with a mortgage rate that seemed high at the time (10%? 12%?) but at least houses cost less than infinity dollars. The traditional script still applied: job, marriage, house, kids. Most of they followed it, more or less, because it still worked.</p><p><strong>Their 30s (1994-2004):</strong> Clinton prosperity to post-9/11 uncertainty. The economy boomed. The stock market seemed like it could only go up. The internet arrived, and suddenly everyone needed a website, an email address, a strategy for something called 'e-commerce.' Their career probably accelerated. Their kids were young. They watched the Berlin Wall fall and thought the future would be peaceful. Then 9/11 happened when they were thirty-seven, and everything pivoted to fear and war. The before and after of that day split their thirties in two.</p><p><strong>Their 40s (2004-2014):</strong> Their peak earning years coincided with the worst financial crash since the Great Depression. They were forty-four when Lehman Brothers collapsed. They watched their 401(k) lose 40% of its value and wondered if they'd ever retire. Their kids became teenagers, then young adults, and launched into an economy with no jobs. They couldn't protect them from it. They could only watch and help where possible and feel guilty about having had it easier.</p><p><strong>Their 50s (2014-2024):</strong> Recovery, sort of. The economy improved. Their investments recovered. But the world felt stranger—political polarization, social media toxicity, a pandemic that isolated everyone. Their parents were aging and dying. Their kids were struggling in ways they didn't fully understand. They were sandwiched between generations, responsible for everyone, supported by no one. At fifty-six, COVID locked they in their house and reminded they that the future is never guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Their 60s and beyond (2024+):</strong> They're here now, or approaching it. Retirement is either happening or a fantasy, depending on how the math worked out. They're navigating aging in a medical system designed to confuse they and a culture that worships youth. Their grandchildren live in devices they don't entirely understand. The world moves faster than they do now. But they've survived things that would have broken lesser generations. The moon landing, Watergate, stagflation, AIDS, 9/11, the Great Recession, COVID. They're still standing. That's not nothing.</p>"
