      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year the Beatles arrived in America and Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. Your birth year was a hinge point—the last year of the Baby Boom, the beginning of something new. You're technically a Boomer, but you've never quite felt like one.</p><p>Your childhood straddled two eras. You were too young to remember JFK's assassination, but old enough to absorb the grief that followed. You watched the moon landing on TV when you were five—old enough to understand it was important, young enough to think such things were normal. Of course we went to the moon. What else would we do?</p><p>Vietnam was the background noise of your childhood. The evening news showed body counts while you ate dinner. Older kids in your neighborhood went to war; some didn't come back. By the time you were old enough to be drafted, the draft was ending. You missed it by that much.</p><p>Your childhood technology was still analog—record players, rotary phones, three TV channels. But change was accelerating. Calculators replaced slide rules. Color TV replaced black and white. The world your older siblings grew up in was already becoming obsolete by the time you entered high school.</p><p>You grew up during Watergate. You were nine when Nixon resigned. You learned early that presidents could lie, that institutions could fail, that the adults in charge didn't always know what they were doing. That lesson stuck.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year A Hard Day's Night premiered and the Beatles held all five top spots on the Billboard Hot 100. British Invasion was the soundtrack of your birth. Mary Poppins came out that December. Dr. Strangelove taught Americans to stop worrying and love the bomb.</p><p>Your childhood was Sesame Street and Schoolhouse Rock. You learned your ABCs from Big Bird and your civics from animated bills on Capitol Hill. Television wasn't just entertainment; it was education—the first generation raised by screens, though no one called it that yet.</p><p>Your teenage years hit during disco and punk—two reactions to the same exhaustion. You were thirteen during the Summer of Sam. Fourteen when Saturday Night Fever turned disco into a lifestyle. Fifteen when the Ramones proved you didn't need talent to make noise that mattered.</p><p>Star Wars came out when you were thirteen. That was the dividing line between the cynical '70s and the blockbuster '80s. Suddenly movies were events again. Suddenly optimism was permitted. You stood in line for hours to see it, and it was worth every minute.</p><p>Your twenties were MTV and Reagan, Madonna and Springsteen, hair metal and hip-hop. Culture fragmented into niches. There was no longer one thing everyone watched, one song everyone knew. You were the last generation to experience mass culture before it shattered into a million pieces.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year IBM introduced the word processor and BASIC programming language was invented. Computers existed, but they were room-sized machines that only corporations and governments could afford. The digital revolution was coming, but it hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>You were twelve when Apple was founded in a garage. Thirteen when the Apple II made personal computers possible. Sixteen when Pac-Man took over arcades. Technology accelerated through your adolescence—each year brought something new, something that made last year's miracles obsolete.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_IPHONE}} when the iPhone launched. By then, you'd already lived through the PC revolution, the internet revolution, and the mobile revolution. You adapted to each wave, more or less successfully. You're fluent enough in technology to function, skeptical enough to remember life without it.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is pragmatic. You didn't grow up with screens in your pocket, so you know they're not necessary for happiness. You use technology as a tool, not a lifestyle. You can still read a paper map, still write in cursive, still remember phone numbers. These skills feel quaint now, but they remind you that the world worked fine before all this.</p><p>You've watched technology promise to connect everyone and somehow make everyone lonelier. You've seen social media go from novelty to necessity to menace. You're old enough to be skeptical, young enough to be online. That's a complicated place to be.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were one when Malcolm X was assassinated. Four when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were killed within months of each other. Five when we landed on the moon. You were too young to understand most of it, but the adults around you were shaken in ways that shaped your childhood.</p><p>You were nine when Nixon resigned. Ten during the fall of Saigon. Eleven during the Bicentennial, when America tried to celebrate itself despite everything. Your childhood was a long national hangover from the '60s—the country recovering from traumas it didn't fully understand.</p><p>You were fifteen when the Iran hostage crisis began. Sixteen when Reagan was elected, promising morning in America. Seventeen when he was shot. The '80s felt like a fresh start, even if it was partly illusion. At least someone was projecting confidence.</p><p>You were twenty-five when the Berlin Wall fell. Twenty-seven when the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War that had defined your parents' entire lives ended while you were still young enough to imagine a different world. For a moment, it seemed like history was over and the good guys had won.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_911}} during 9/11. Old enough to have a career, a family, a life that was suddenly interrupted by history. You watched the towers fall and knew immediately that everything had changed. Your children would grow up in a different country than the one you'd known.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}} during the 2008 financial crisis—peak earning years disrupted by the worst crash since the Depression. You were {{AGE_AT_COVID}} during COVID. History keeps happening, faster and stranger than anyone predicted.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around {{WORKFORCE_ENTRY_YEAR}}, when the economy was recovering from the early '80s recession. Jobs existed. Careers were possible. The contract between employer and employee was fraying but not yet shredded. You could still expect to spend decades at one company if you wanted to.</p><p>Your career spanned the transition from analog to digital workplaces. You learned to type on typewriters, then word processors, then computers. You adapted to email, then the internet, then smartphones. Each wave required reinvention. You managed, mostly, but it was exhausting.</p><p>You saw corporate culture shift from loyalty to efficiency. Layoffs became normal. Pensions became 401(k)s. The promise that hard work would be rewarded with security evaporated somewhere in the '90s, and by the time you noticed, it was too late to do anything about it.</p><p>You're likely in the final stretch of your career now, or already retired. You've worked through multiple recessions, technological revolutions, and complete transformations of your industry. The job you started doing in your twenties probably doesn't exist anymore. You've had to reinvent yourself more times than you expected.</p><p>Your retirement depends on how well the markets perform, how long Social Security lasts, and whether your health holds. These are not certainties. Your generation was promised security and delivered volatility. You've learned to plan for contingencies.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were ten during the oil crisis, when gas lines and inflation made the economy feel precarious. Fourteen during the brutal 1979-1982 recession. Your financial coming-of-age happened during stagflation—the economy can be terrible in multiple ways simultaneously. That lesson stuck.</p><p>You bought your first house when houses were still affordable, but not as cheap as they'd been for older Boomers. You accumulated wealth, but perhaps not as much as you expected. The stock market boom of the '90s helped; the crashes of 2000 and 2008 hurt. Your net worth has been a roller coaster.</p><p>You're probably more conservative financially than younger generations assume. You've seen too many crashes to trust that markets only go up. You've watched retirement savings evaporate overnight. You know that security is an illusion, but you still want it.</p><p>Your relationship with money is shaped by watching both abundance and scarcity. Your parents survived the Depression; you survived stagflation and multiple recessions. You've had it better than your kids and worse than your older siblings. That's a confusing place to be.</p><p>You're the last Boomers, which means you're often lumped in with people who had it easier than you did. The early Boomers bought houses for nothing. You bought houses for something. The difference matters, even if no one acknowledges it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> Reagan era. You launched careers during the recovery from the early '80s recession. MTV, cocaine, shoulder pads—the '80s were excessive and you were young enough to participate. You probably got married, bought a house, started a family. The traditional script still applied, mostly.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> Clinton era. The economy boomed. Technology exploded. Your careers accelerated. You watched the Berlin Wall fall and the Soviet Union collapse. The future seemed bright. Your kids were young. Everything felt possible.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Your peak earning years coincided with 9/11 and its aftermath. The optimism of the '90s curdled into fear and war. You watched your country change in ways you didn't expect. Your kids became teenagers. The world you were preparing them for wasn't the world that was arriving.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> The 2008 financial crisis hit your retirement savings hard. You watched your 401(k) crater and wondered if you'd ever be able to stop working. Your kids launched into the worst economy since the Depression. You worried about them in ways your parents never worried about you.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_PLUS}}+):</strong> You're in retirement or approaching it. COVID disrupted whatever plans you had. You're navigating aging in a world that worships youth, managing health in a system designed to confuse you, trying to help kids who are struggling more than you did. You're the last of the Boomers—old enough to remember the good times, young enough to know they're not coming back.</p>"
