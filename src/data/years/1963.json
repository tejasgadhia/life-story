      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1963-1975</h2><p>You were born the year America lost its innocence. November 22nd, 1963—JFK was assassinated in Dallas. Your first year of life happened against a backdrop of national mourning, the Warren Commission, and a country trying to understand how everything could change in one afternoon in Texas.</p><p>Your childhood was the 1960s in full swing. The Beatles invaded when you were barely a year old. By the time you were five, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were dead, cities were burning, and Vietnam was on the evening news every single night. You don't remember most of this directly, but it was the water you swam in.</p><p>You grew up in the era of three TV channels, rotary phones, and milk delivered to your doorstep. Air conditioning was a luxury. Seatbelts were optional suggestions. Your parents smoked in the car with the windows up. The playground equipment was metal, concrete, and occasionally on fire. Somehow, you survived.</p><p>Your elementary school years coincided with the moon landing—you were six, old enough to remember watching it on a grainy black-and-white television. Neil Armstrong stepping onto the lunar surface was supposed to be the beginning of something. It turned out to be more of an ending. America stopped going to the moon and started going to shopping malls instead.</p><p>By the time you hit middle school, Watergate was unraveling. You watched a president resign in disgrace. The gas crisis meant long lines at stations. The optimism of the early '60s had curdled into the malaise of the '70s. Your formative years tracked perfectly with America's loss of confidence in its own institutions.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. You're part of the generation named for the post-WWII population explosion—76 million people born in the United States during that eighteen-year span. Your parents came home from the war, bought houses in the suburbs, and got busy making you.</p><p>As a 1963 baby, you're a late Boomer—sometimes called 'Generation Jones.' You missed Woodstock. You were too young for Vietnam but old enough to see its aftermath destroy your older siblings' friends. You got the hangover of the '60s counterculture without the party.</p><p>Your generation's defining trait is size. You were the largest generation in American history until Millennials overtook you. This meant crowded classrooms, competitive college admissions, and a job market that absorbed millions of you anyway because the economy was still growing. Lucky timing, mostly.</p><p>Boomers get blamed for a lot these days—pulling the ladder up behind them, hoarding wealth, refusing to retire, destroying the housing market. Some of that criticism is fair. Some of it confuses individual Boomers with the systems they inherited and perpetuated. You weren't thinking about generational economics when you bought a house for $40,000 in 1985. You were just living your life.</p><p>The unifying experience for Boomers is the '60s, even though half of you barely remember them. JFK, MLK, RFK, Vietnam, the moon landing, Watergate—these events are your generational mythology, the stories you tell to explain who you are and where you came from.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year 'The Feminine Mystique' was published, the year Beatlemania began in Britain, the year Hitchcock released 'The Birds.' The cultural landscape was shifting beneath the surface, and you arrived just in time to ride the wave.</p><p>Your childhood soundscape was Motown—The Supremes, The Temptations, Marvin Gaye. By the time you were old enough to buy records, disco was inescapable. You probably had a leisure suit. You might have worn platform shoes. Bee Gees and Donna Summer defined your high school years, whether you liked it or not.</p><p>Television in your childhood was 'Bonanza,' 'The Andy Griffith Show,' and 'Bewitched.' By your teenage years, it was 'Happy Days,' 'M*A*S*H,' and 'All in the Family'—shows that processed the trauma of Vietnam and social change through the safe distance of fiction and comedy.</p><p>Movies of your adolescence were 'The Godfather,' 'Jaws,' 'Star Wars,' and 'Saturday Night Fever.' Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola were reinventing cinema while you sat in theaters with sticky floors and Milk Duds. Blockbuster culture was being invented in real-time.</p><p>You were seventeen when MTV launched, old enough to recognize it as something genuinely new. Music videos turned songs into movies. Michael Jackson moonwalked into history. Madonna shocked your parents. Hair bands made perms acceptable for men. The '80s were absurd, excessive, and weirdly optimistic after the grimness of the '70s.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the push-button telephone began replacing rotary dials—though your family probably kept the rotary well into the '70s because it still worked fine. Touch-Tone was the future, but the future took its time arriving.</p><p>Your childhood technology was analog to its core. Typewriters, record players, slide rules. Your family might have had a color TV by the late '60s—it was still a luxury. Calculators cost hundreds of dollars and did basic math poorly. The idea of a computer in your home was science fiction.</p><p>You were twenty when the personal computer revolution began. The IBM PC arrived in 1981. The Macintosh followed in 1984. You watched offices transform from paper and carbon copies to glowing screens and dot matrix printers. Some of you adapted quickly. Others typed with two fingers forever.</p><p>The internet happened when you were in your thirties and forties. Email replaced memos. Websites replaced catalogs. Amazon started selling books. Google started organizing information. You learned to use these tools as adults, which is different from growing up with them. The transition was gradual, then sudden.</p><p>You're old enough to remember when long-distance calls were expensive, when getting directions meant unfolding a paper map, when looking something up meant going to the library. You've lived through more technological change than any generation before you—from party lines to smartphones, from three TV channels to infinite streaming.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is practical. You use what works. You're skeptical of what seems unnecessary. You have a smartphone, but you still remember when phones were attached to walls and nobody expected you to be reachable 24/7.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born nine months before JFK was assassinated. Your birth year is permanently marked by that November afternoon in Dallas. The optimism of Camelot ended before you could experience it directly, but you grew up in its shadow.</p><p>You were two when the Voting Rights Act passed. Five when MLK and RFK were killed within two months of each other. Six when humans walked on the moon. Seven when the National Guard shot students at Kent State. Your childhood was a parade of historical trauma punctuated by occasional moments of transcendence.</p><p>You were eleven during Watergate, old enough to understand that the president was a crook and that your parents were angry about something they watched on television every night. Nixon's resignation was the second presidential exit of your young life. Institutions seemed fragile.</p><p>You were sixteen during the Iranian hostage crisis, eighteen when Reagan was shot, nineteen when the AIDS crisis began (though nobody called it that yet). The Cold War was the background radiation of your entire life—duck-and-cover drills, nuclear anxiety, the constant low hum of potential annihilation.</p><p>You were twenty-six when the Berlin Wall fell. Twenty-eight when the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War you'd grown up with just... ended. The world was supposed to be different after that. In some ways it was. In other ways, new anxieties rushed in to fill the void.</p><p>By your forties, 9/11 happened. The towers fell when you were thirty-eight. You'd lived through assassinations, a presidential resignation, and the end of the Cold War. This was different—an attack on American soil, a new kind of enemy, the beginning of forever wars you'd watch your children and grandchildren fight.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the early 1980s, during a recession that felt catastrophic but was mild compared to what came later. Interest rates were insane—20% mortgages. Unemployment was high. But the economy recovered, and the Reagan boom lifted a lot of boats, including yours.</p><p>Your generation is the last to remember when a job meant a job. You started somewhere, you stayed, you got promoted, you retired with a pension. That model was already dying by the time you reached middle management, but you caught the tail end of it. Loyalty meant something, briefly.</p><p>You were the first generation to navigate the personal computer revolution mid-career. Some of you became early adopters, building expertise that made you invaluable. Others resisted, learned the minimum necessary, and complained about how things used to be easier. Both groups retired eventually.</p><p>Corporate culture changed dramatically during your career. When you started, offices were hierarchical, formal, gendered. Men wore suits. Women were secretaries. By the time you retired—or stopped working, or downshifted—offices had casual Fridays, diversity training, and young people who thought email was too formal.</p><p>You're the generation that accumulated wealth. Not because you were smarter or worked harder, but because timing is everything. You bought houses when they were cheap. You invested in stock markets that mostly went up. Your pensions, if you had them, were funded. You benefited from systems that stopped benefiting people the moment you finished using them.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You probably met your spouse through mutual friends, work, church, or school. There were no dating apps, no algorithms, no swiping. You met people in physical spaces and decided if you liked them based on conversation. It sounds quaint now. It was just how things worked.</p><p>Your generation married younger than those who came after. The average age of first marriage in the mid-'80s was 23 for women and 25 for men. You probably hit those benchmarks within a few years. Divorce rates peaked around the same time—your parents' generation was splitting up while you were trying to figure out how to make marriage work.</p><p>Communication in your early relationships meant phone calls on landlines, letters, and showing up in person. Long-distance relationships required scheduling calls around time zones and long-distance rates. Missing someone meant actually missing them, not scrolling through their Instagram.</p><p>Your generation raised kids during the transition from analog to digital. You had to make decisions about technology that your parents never faced—how much TV is too much, when do kids get a computer, what about video games. Then came cell phones. Then smartphones. Then social media. You made rules as you went.</p><p>You're probably grandparents now, or approaching it. Your relationships with your adult children are mediated by technology that didn't exist when they were young. You text, you video call, you get photos instantly. Connection is easier and somehow also more distant. You see more but understand less.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You remember the stagflation of the '70s—high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously, which wasn't supposed to be possible. You remember interest rates that made mortgages nearly impossible. Then you bought a house in the '80s or '90s for a price that seems fictional now.</p><p>Your financial psychology was shaped by post-war prosperity and '70s scarcity. You learned to save because things could get bad. You also learned to spend because things usually got better. This optimism served you well—markets rose, real estate appreciated, pensions held together until you needed them.</p><p>You're the wealthiest generation in history. Boomers control over 50% of American wealth. Your houses appreciated. Your 401(k)s grew. Your Social Security is funded, mostly. You had the advantage of buying assets when they were cheap and watching them become expensive as you aged.</p><p>This creates tension with younger generations who can't replicate your path. They hear 'I bought my first house at 27' and don't hear the part about how houses cost three times the median income then, not ten times. The advice you'd give—save, invest, buy property—isn't wrong, but it's incomplete. The rules changed.</p><p>Your retirement, if you're there or approaching it, is better funded than any generation before or since. You might worry about money anyway—financial anxiety doesn't disappear with a healthy portfolio. But statistically, you'll be fine. The question is whether you'll be comfortable while your kids struggle and your grandkids inherit a different economy entirely.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your biggest blind spot is probably the assumption that your path is replicable. You worked hard, but you also arrived at exactly the right time. The economy was growing. Houses were cheap. Jobs came with benefits. Education didn't require a second mortgage. These weren't universal truths—they were historical contingencies that happened to align in your favor.</p><p>You may underestimate how much harder things have become. Not because people are lazier or less capable, but because the systems that supported your success were dismantled. Pensions became 401(k)s. Stable employment became gig work. Healthcare became unaffordable. The ladder you climbed got shorter and more crowded after you reached the top.</p><p>Your generation sometimes confuses correlation with causation. You succeeded because you made good choices, sure. But you also succeeded because good choices were available. The kid today making the same choices you made at their age gets a different outcome because the game changed.</p><p>Boomers can be defensive about generational criticism, which is understandable but not productive. Yes, you worked hard. Yes, you built things. But your generation also voted for policies that shifted burdens onto future generations—tax cuts without spending cuts, environmental degradation, underfunded infrastructure. The receipts are extensive.</p><p>The hardest thing to see from where you stand is how different the view is from where your kids and grandkids stand. They're not ungrateful or entitled. They're struggling with challenges you didn't face in the same way. Understanding that gap is the work of late adulthood.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1983-1993):</strong> You graduated into Reagan's America. The economy recovered from the early-'80s recession and kept growing. You probably found a job that led somewhere—not necessarily your dream, but something with a future. You might have married, bought a starter home, started thinking about kids. The Cold War ended. The Soviet Union collapsed. Everything seemed to be getting better.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1993-2003):</strong> The Clinton years. The tech boom. Your career likely hit its stride. You had kids and worried about schools, neighborhoods, college funds. The internet happened—slowly at first, then everywhere. Y2K was supposed to destroy civilization but didn't. You entered the new millennium established, adult, responsible for more than yourself.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2003-2013):</strong> 9/11 happened when you were 38. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq defined your forties like Vietnam defined your parents' middle age. The 2008 financial crisis might have hit your 401(k), your home value, your sense of security. You watched your kids become teenagers, then adults. The world they inherited wasn't the one you'd expected to give them.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2013-2023):</strong> Peak earning years, probably. Peak responsibility too—aging parents, adult children who needed help, grandchildren arriving. Social media made it easier to stay connected and harder to escape from politics, family drama, and endless opinions. You started thinking about retirement, or at least working differently. The pandemic hit when you were 56-57, either accelerating your exit from the workforce or reminding you how much you valued purpose.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2023-2033):</strong> You're here now or approaching it. Retirement is either happening or being negotiated. Your health matters more than it used to. The world is different from the one you grew up in—politically, technologically, culturally. Your grandchildren are growing up with devices and anxieties you can barely understand. Your job now is figuring out what this phase means for you.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2033+):</strong> Late life. The concerns shift toward legacy, meaning, health, family. You'll have lived through more history than most humans who ever existed—from JFK's assassination to whatever comes next. You'll be a primary source for a world that younger people can only read about. How you spend this time, what you pass on, what stories you tell—that's the work now.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.1 million people born in 1963—one of the largest single-year cohorts in American history. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people, though that number shrinks every year as mortality claims its share.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you grew up with more affluence, less trauma, and less deference to authority. They survived the Depression and fought World War II. You watched their wars end on television and questioned why they started. They trusted institutions. You learned to distrust them.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had it easier. They're the forgotten middle child of generations—too young for the '60s, too old for the digital native thing. They entered the workforce when the rules were already changing but before the safety nets were fully dismantled. They're scrappier than you, more cynical, and less sentimental about the institutions you still believe in.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. You bought houses when they cost a few years' salary. They rent apartments that cost half their income. You had pensions. They have debt. Your career path was linear. Theirs is a gig economy labyrinth. The criticism of Boomers often comes from this generation, and it's not baseless.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. They've never known a world without the internet, without smartphones, without social media. Their anxieties are different—climate change, mass shootings, economic precarity as a permanent condition. They look at your generation and see the people who had everything and left them nothing. That's not entirely fair, but it's not entirely wrong either.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've already beaten that. Medical advances, declining smoking rates, and better heart disease treatment mean you're likely to live into your eighties, maybe longer. The question isn't just how long, but how well—and what you do with the time you have left.</p>"
