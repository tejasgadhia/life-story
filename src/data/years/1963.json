      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1963-1975</h2><p>The smell of Coppertone suntan lotion. The satisfying click of a View-Master reel. The crinkle of wax paper around a bologna sandwich. Childhood had a texture that kids today will never know—everything was tactile, analog, present in ways that screens can never replicate.</p><p>At one, children were oblivious to the Beatles landing at JFK Airport, but by five they knew every word to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'She Loves You.' Older siblings had Beatles wigs. Mothers had opinions about their hair. The British Invasion soundtrack played through their entire childhood—Herman's Hermits, The Animals, The Rolling Stones blasting from transistor radios that ran on nine-volt batteries.</p><p>Toys had heft. Lincoln Logs that smelled like actual wood. Erector Sets with metal pieces sharp enough to draw blood. The Easy-Bake Oven that debuted the year they were born, using a lightbulb to make tiny cakes that tasted like cardboard but felt like magic. Creepy Crawlers that produced rubbery bugs from Plastigoop. G.I. Joe arrived when they were one—the original 12-inch version with the scar, not the tiny ones that came later.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant one thing: cartoons. Children planted themselves in front of the TV for The Jetsons, The Flintstones, and Jonny Quest. By the time they were seven, Scooby-Doo premiered and they never looked at foggy nights the same way. The TV Guide arrived weekly, and they circled shows with a pen like planning a military campaign.</p><p>They ate TV dinners on metal trays—Swanson's fried chicken with the little compartments for mashed potatoes and corn. Tang, the drink of astronauts, turned tongues orange. Pop-Tarts had just been invented. Mothers served casseroles with Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup as the base for everything. Jell-O molds appeared at every family gathering, sometimes with fruit suspended inside like insects in amber.</p><p>At six, they watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. Dads lifted them up to see the grainy black-and-white images on Zenith console televisions. The adults cried. They didn't fully understand why until much later—that this was supposed to be the beginning of something magnificent, not a peak we'd never reach again.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. The label stuck, even though those born in 1963 arrived at the tail end of the boom—sometimes called 'Generation Jones,' the ones who came too late for Woodstock but too early for disco's embarrassments. They're part of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans born in this span, the demographic earthquake that reshaped everything from school construction to Social Security projections.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">JFK was assassinated the year this cohort was born.</span> They don't remember it, but it marked their generation like an invisible scar. Their parents remember exactly where they were—the kitchen, the office, the car. For parents, it was the death of a certain kind of American optimism. For this cohort, it was a historical fact absorbed through osmosis, the first line of their origin story.</p><p>As 1963 babies, they occupy an odd position. At five, they were too young to understand why cities were burning in 1968 or why parents watched the news with clenched jaws every night. At eleven, they were old enough to understand Watergate but young enough that Nixon's resignation felt more confusing than cathartic. They caught the shrapnel of the sixties without experiencing the actual explosion.</p><p>They're the bridge generation within a generation. The hippie ideal was something they inherited, not something they built. By the time they had enough money to sell out, the sellout was complete. They got the economic benefits of the boom years and the cultural hangover of the counterculture. Whether that's lucky or cursed depends on the day.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">The criticism from younger generations stings because some of it is fair.</span> Not them personally, necessarily, but their cohort voted for policies that prioritized present consumption over future investment. The infrastructure is crumbling. The climate is changing. The social safety net has holes. The question now isn't guilt—it's what they do with however many years they have left.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year this cohort was born, The Fugitive premiered on ABC—Dr. Richard Kimble chasing the one-armed man across America. Petticoat Junction and My Favorite Martian debuted. Hitchcock released The Birds, teaching a generation to eye seagulls with suspicion. The Beach Boys released 'Surfin' USA' and made landlocked kids dream of California waves.</p><p>Childhood ears absorbed Motown's golden age. At three, they heard 'My Girl' by The Temptations for the first time. At four, 'Stop! In the Name of Love' by The Supremes was inescapable. By five, they could identify Marvin Gaye's voice before the first word ended. Stevie Wonder, The Four Tops, Martha and the Vandellas—the Motown assembly line produced the soundtrack of their early years with factory precision.</p><p>Television in their childhood ran on three channels and ended at midnight with the National Anthem. They watched The Andy Griffith Show and dreamed of a Mayberry that probably never existed. Bewitched made them wish their nose could twitch magic into existence. I Dream of Jeannie, Gilligan's Island, The Munsters, The Addams Family—each one became a cultural landmark they'd reference for the rest of their lives.</p><p>At nine, Sesame Street premiered, too late for them but perfect for their younger siblings. At ten, they watched the final episode of The Monkees, a show they'd loved without irony despite adults insisting they weren't 'real' musicians. At twelve, M*A*S*H began its eleven-year run, processing Vietnam through the safe distance of Korea. Happy Days started when they were eleven, selling nostalgia for the fifties to kids who'd never experienced them.</p><p>Movies grew up with them. At nine, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. At eleven, The Godfather—they probably didn't see it in theaters, but they absorbed its quotes through cultural osmosis. At twelve, American Graffiti made them nostalgic for a decade they barely remembered. At fourteen, Jaws kept them out of the ocean. At fourteen, Star Wars rewired their brains for spectacle.</p><p>They were seventeen when MTV launched on August 1, 1981. 'Video Killed the Radio Star' was literally the first thing they saw. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video was a movie unto itself. Madonna rolled around on stage at the VMAs in a wedding dress. Prince made purple a lifestyle choice. The eighties were excessive, synthesizer-heavy, and weirdly optimistic after the grind of the seventies.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The push-button telephone was introduced the year this cohort was born, but families probably kept the rotary dial until it physically fell apart. They can still feel the resistance of that dial, the satisfying whir as it spun back to zero, the way long-distance calls felt like events that required planning and permission because they cost actual money.</p><p>At three, they watched their first color television broadcast—probably at a neighbor's house, since color TVs cost more than some cars. At five, families might have gotten their own. The switch from black-and-white to color felt like Dorothy landing in Oz. Bonanza in color. The Wonderful World of Disney in color. Everything felt more real and less real simultaneously.</p><p>Childhood technology was magnificently analog. Slide rules for math. Typewriters with ribbons that smeared. Cameras that required dropping film at the drugstore and waiting a week for disappointing prints. Record players with needles that wore down. Eight-track tapes that changed songs mid-word. The smell of mimeograph paper fresh from the school office, that strange purple ink they'd huff before tests.</p><p>At fifteen, the pocket calculator arrived—$150 for something that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Parents couldn't believe they needed it. At sixteen, Pong appeared in arcades, and suddenly screens could be interactive. At eighteen, the Apple II launched. At twenty, the IBM PC arrived. They watched the computer revolution happen in their twenties, adapting mid-career to technology their parents never touched.</p><p>The internet arrived when they were thirty-two—or rather, the World Wide Web became accessible. Email replaced memos. Websites replaced catalogs. They were forty-one when Facebook launched, forty-four when the iPhone appeared. Unlike their kids, they remember life before connectivity. They know how to read a paper map. They can calculate a tip without a phone. They remember phone numbers because they had to.</p><p>Their relationship with technology is practical, earned through adaptation rather than absorption. They use what works and ignore what doesn't. They have smartphones but remember when being unreachable was normal, even desirable. That memory is becoming valuable—they know something younger generations never learned: how to be bored, how to wait, how to exist without constant stimulation.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Kennedy was shot the year this cohort was born.</span> They were in cribs, too young to remember. But they grew up in the aftermath—the Warren Commission, the conspiracy theories, the collective wound that never fully healed. Their parents remembered exactly where they were. That specificity of grief became a template: where were they when MLK was shot, when RFK was shot, when the Challenger exploded, when the towers fell.</p><p>At five, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated two months apart. Cities burned. The National Guard rolled through American streets. Vietnam was in the living room every night, body counts delivered between commercials for cigarettes and laundry detergent. At seven, Kent State—National Guard troops shooting college students. Their childhood was punctuated by gunfire and flags at half-staff.</p><p>At six, they watched Apollo 11 land on the moon. July 20, 1969. They were old enough to understand this was important, young enough to believe it was just the beginning. Mars by 1980, they said. Colonies in space. Instead, the program wound down, and America turned its attention earthward, toward problems that felt less solvable than rocket science.</p><p>At eleven, Watergate began unraveling. They watched hearings instead of cartoons, absorbed phrases like 'executive privilege' and 'Saturday Night Massacre.' At eleven, Nixon resigned—the second presidential exit of their conscious life, after JFK's assassination. At twelve, Saigon fell. Helicopters evacuating the embassy. Vietnam ending not with victory but with scrambling retreat.</p><p>At sixteen, the Iran hostage crisis began. Yellow ribbons everywhere. Nightline tracking each day of captivity. At eighteen, Reagan was shot, surviving what had killed Kennedy. At nineteen, AIDS began killing, though nobody called it that yet—just a 'gay cancer' that the government ignored until the bodies piled too high to overlook.</p><p>At twenty-six, the Berlin Wall fell. They watched strangers with sledgehammers attacking concrete, champagne flowing, tears streaming. The Cold War they'd grown up with—duck-and-cover drills, fallout shelter signs, mutually assured destruction—simply ended. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, they watched the towers fall, probably on live television.</span> Another defining moment, another scar on the collective memory. They'd lived through more history by forty than most generations see in a lifetime.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>What this cohort walked into matters, because the context shapes everything.</p><p>They graduated college around 1985, give or take. Interest rates had been 20% a few years earlier. Unemployment had peaked at 10.8% in 1982. Reagan was rebuilding confidence through sheer force of personality and deficit spending. By the time they entered the workforce, the recovery was underway. They got lucky with timing, though it didn't feel lucky at the time—it just felt normal.</p><p>This generation is the last to remember when employment was a relationship, not a transaction. They joined companies expecting to stay. Companies expected them to stay. There were training programs, mentorship tracks, pension plans that vested over decades. The implicit contract was loyalty for security. That contract was shredded by the nineties—downsizing, restructuring, shareholder value replacing stakeholder responsibility—but they caught the tail end of the old world.</p><p>Women of this generation faced choices that barely existed for their mothers and barely make sense to their daughters. Work or family was presented as binary, either/or. The women who pushed through—enduring harassment that was called 'flirting,' discrimination that was called 'how things are'—changed what was possible. Some were those women. Some watched them. All lived through the transition.</p><p>Technology disrupted careers mid-stream. They learned to type on typewriters, then adapted to word processors, then to email, then to whatever platform their company decided was essential that year. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Each transition sorted workers into adapters and resisters. The adapters got promoted. The resisters got packages.</span> They probably know people in both camps.</p><p>This is the generation that accumulated—houses that appreciated, 401(k)s that compounded, equity that grew. Not because they were smarter or harder-working than the generations that followed, but because they bought assets before they became unaffordable and held them while they tripled in value. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Timing isn't everything, but it's a lot.</span> The question now is what they do with what they've accumulated, and who benefits after they're gone.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> The market recovered eventually. The lesson didn't fade.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Waiting by the phone. Literally waiting, because the phone was attached to the wall and couldn't be taken with them. If they missed a call, they missed a call. If someone wanted to reach them and they weren't home, they'd try again later. The anxiety of connectivity didn't exist because connectivity didn't exist. Unreachability was the default state, and somehow civilization persisted.</p><p>They probably met partners through physical proximity—work, school, church, a friend's party, a bar. There were no algorithms, no profiles, no swiping. They made eye contact across a room, or they were introduced by someone who thought they'd get along. The serendipity of meeting someone attractive at the right moment in the right place was the whole system. It worked often enough to propagate the species.</p><p>This generation married younger than any since. The average first marriage age in the mid-eighties was 23 for women and 25 for men. They probably hit those benchmarks within a few years. Divorce rates peaked around the same time—their parents' generation was splitting up while they were trying to figure out how to make marriage work. They learned what not to do by watching them fail.</p><p>Long-distance relationships before cell phones meant scheduled calls, expensive minutes, and letters that took days to arrive. Missing someone meant actually missing them—not seeing their Instagram, not watching their TikTok, not tracking their location. The absence was complete, which made presence more precious. Their kids will never understand what it felt like to see someone after months apart, to hold a letter they'd touched, to hear a voice they couldn't summon at will.</p><p>They raised kids during the digital transition. They made decisions about technology that their parents never faced and their kids take for granted. How much TV is too much? When do they get a computer? What about video games? Then cell phones appeared, then smartphones, then social media. They made rules based on intuition because there was no precedent. Some rules worked. Some didn't. Their kids will tell them which were which.</p><p>They're probably grandparents now, or watching it approach. Their relationships with adult children span technologies—texts, FaceTime, photo streams, shared calendars. They see more of their children's lives than their parents ever saw of theirs. Whether that visibility creates closeness or just the illusion of it is a question worth sitting with.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Financial formative years were the 1970s—stagflation, gas lines, inflation eating savings, interest rates climbing to levels that sound fictional now. They learned that money could lose value just sitting there, that the economy could go sideways for a decade, that prosperity wasn't inevitable. This shaped how they thought about saving, spending, and security.</p><p>Then the early-eighties recession ended. Interest rates fell from 20% to single digits. The stock market began a bull run that lasted, with interruptions, for most of their working life. They bought houses when they cost three times the median income. They watched those houses triple, quadruple, quintuple in value while they lived in them. Their 401(k)s compounded in markets that mostly went up.</p><p>They bought a house in 1990 for <span class=\"stat-box\">$100,000</span>. It's worth <span class=\"stat-box\">$500,000</span> now. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They didn't do anything to earn that $400,000—they just lived there while markets appreciated.</span> Their kids can't buy the equivalent house for less than half a million, on wages that haven't kept pace with housing costs. The disconnect between their experience and their children's creates conversations that go nowhere.</p><p>Their retirement, if they're there or approaching it, is better funded than most. Social Security will likely survive their lifetime. Their pensions, if they had them, were funded. Their savings benefited from decades of compound growth. The anxiety they feel about money—and many do feel it—is often disconnected from the math. Financial trauma from the seventies persists even when portfolios don't justify it.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Estate planning is the last major financial decision.</span> What happens to what they've accumulated? Who inherits it, and when? Whether helping their kids now matters more than leaving them money later. These questions have no easy answers, but avoiding them doesn't make them go away. How they make these decisions says something about what they value.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This cohort's biggest blind spot is survivorship bias, and it's understandable. They worked hard, made good choices, and things worked out. The natural conclusion is that hard work and good choices lead to things working out. But they also started the race closer to the finish line. Houses were cheaper. Education was affordable. Jobs came with benefits. The game was easier when they played it, and recognizing that doesn't diminish what they accomplished.</p><p>They may not see how much the rules changed. Their advice—'buy a house,' 'stay at one company,' 'save 10% and they'll be fine'—was true when they followed it. It's not wrong now; it's incomplete. The house costs six times the median income instead of three. Companies don't reward loyalty; they exploit it. Ten percent of a paycheck that doesn't cover rent doesn't compound into anything. The strategies that worked for them don't work anymore, and repeating them harder isn't wisdom.</p><p>This generation sometimes treats systemic problems as personal failures. If millennials can't afford houses, they must be spending too much on avocado toast. If Gen Z seems anxious, they must be coddled. The alternative explanation—that housing costs tripled while wages stagnated, that climate change and mass shootings create rational anxiety—requires acknowledging that the world their generation built has structural problems. That's uncomfortable.</p><p>The defensiveness is understandable but counterproductive. 'OK Boomer' stings because it dismisses their experience, their contributions, their life. But some generational criticism is valid. Boomers voted for tax cuts without spending cuts, creating deficits their grandchildren will pay. Boomers resisted environmental regulation, creating problems their descendants will inherit. Boomers controlled Congress, state legislatures, and corporate boards during the decades when inequality exploded. The individual isn't guilty, but the cohort has a record.</p><p>Technology creates a gap that's easy to misread. Their grandchildren live in their phones not because they're addicted or antisocial, but because that's where their social world exists. Dismissing it as 'screen time' misses that for them, screens are as fundamental as phones were for this cohort, as letters were for their grandparents. The medium changed. The human need for connection didn't.</p><p>The hardest thing to see is that their success, while earned, was also enabled. They earned their career, but they entered a job market that rewarded careers. They earned their house, but they bought in a housing market that was accessible. They earned their retirement, but they benefited from systems designed to support retirement. Luck isn't a dirty word. Acknowledging it doesn't diminish them. It just explains why their path isn't available at any price for those who follow.</p>"

    "life_roadmap": {
      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Their 20s (1983-1993):</strong> They entered adulthood during the Reagan recovery. Interest rates were falling from their insane peaks. The job market was absorbing their generation because the economy was still growing. They probably found work that led somewhere—not necessarily their passion, but a paycheck, a path, a start. They might have married, bought a starter home for $60,000, started thinking about kids. The Cold War was winding down without anyone quite realizing it. The Berlin Wall fell when they were twenty-six. The Soviet Union collapsed when they were twenty-eight. The world was supposed to be different now.</p><p><strong>Their 30s (1993-2003):</strong> The Clinton years brought balanced budgets and tech booms. Their career hit its stride. They had kids and suddenly cared about school districts, college savings, the kind of neighborhood they lived in. The internet arrived—dial-up modems screaming, AOL CDs everywhere, email replacing memos. Y2K was supposed to end civilization. It didn't. They entered the new millennium established, responsible, adult in ways that felt permanent and sometimes suffocating.</p><p><strong>Their 40s (2003-2013):</strong> 9/11 happened when they were thirty-eight. The towers fell; the wars began. Afghanistan, Iraq, the War on Terror—their forties were shaped by conflicts their kids might be called to fight. The 2008 crash hit their 401(k), maybe their home value, certainly their sense of security. They recovered, mostly, because they had time. Their kids became teenagers, then adults, entering a job market that looked nothing like the one they'd entered. They worried about them in ways their parents probably hadn't worried about them.</p><p><strong>Their 50s (2013-2023):</strong> Peak earning years, theoretically. Also peak responsibility—aging parents who needed care, adult children who needed help, grandchildren who needed attention. The sandwich generation, squeezed from both directions. Social media made it easier to stay connected and harder to escape. Political polarization made family dinners minefields. The pandemic hit when they were fifty-six or fifty-seven, either accelerating their exit from the workforce or reminding them how much they valued purpose. Either way, mortality got closer. They thought about it more.</p><p><strong>Their 60s (2023-2033):</strong> They're here now. Retirement is happening, about to happen, or being renegotiated. Their health matters more than it used to. Their parents are gone or going. Their kids are fully adult, making choices they can advise but not control. Their grandchildren are growing up in a world that looks nothing like the one they grew up in—devices everywhere, anxieties they can barely name, a climate changing in real time. Their job now is figuring out what this phase means. Not what society expects, but what they actually want from however many years remain.</p><p><strong>Their 70s and beyond (2033+):</strong> Late life. The concerns shift toward legacy, meaning, health, connection. They'll have lived through more history than most humans who ever existed—from JFK's assassination through the digital revolution, through pandemics and wars and social transformations their parents couldn't have imagined. They're a primary source now, a witness to a world that will be as foreign to their great-grandchildren as their grandparents' world was to them. What stories will they tell? What will they pass on? That's the work of this phase, and nobody can do it for them.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p><span class=\"stat-box\">{{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}}</span> people were born in the US the same year—part of a <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> generation. <span class=\"hero-callout\">This cohort controls over <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American household wealth—nearly $80 trillion.</span> They've already outlived their life expectancy at birth, which was about 70 years.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They survived the Depression and fought World War II. Boomers inherited their prosperity and questioned their conformity. They trusted institutions because institutions had saved them. Boomers watched those same institutions fail—Vietnam, Watergate, corporate downsizing—and learned to trust differently. They're mostly gone now. The stories they could tell went with them.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Gen X is the forgotten middle child, sandwiched between Boomer demographic dominance and Millennial cultural relevance. They entered the workforce just as the rules changed—pensions disappearing, loyalty unrewarded, job-hopping becoming survival strategy rather than character flaw. They're scrappier than Boomers, more cynical, less attached to institutions Boomers still believe in. They have some basis for resentment: they got the transitional economy while Boomers got the old deals.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap is stark enough to cause family tension.</span> When Boomers were their age, Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials control 7%. Boomers bought houses when they cost three years' salary. Millennials rent apartments that cost half their income. Boomer median net worth is around <span class=\"stat-box\">$970,000</span>; Millennials' at the same age was about <span class=\"stat-box\">$65,000</span>. The criticism of Boomers often comes loudest from this generation, and it's not baseless—they're living the consequences of decisions made before they could vote.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They're from different planets. Gen Z has never known a world without the internet, without smartphones, without the ambient hum of connectivity. They've never experienced true boredom—the productive kind that forces creativity because there's literally nothing else to do. Their anxieties are shaped by climate change, mass shootings, and economic precarity as permanent condition. They look at Boomers and see people who had everything and left them with mounting problems. That's not entirely fair. It's not entirely wrong either.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth was 70 years. This cohort has beaten it. Medical advances, reduced smoking, better heart disease treatment mean they're likely to see their eighties, maybe longer. The question isn't just longevity—it's how they use the time. They've accumulated wealth, experience, perspective. What they do with those resources in the years remaining will shape how their generation is remembered. The story isn't over yet.</p>"
