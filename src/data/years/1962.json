      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1962-1974</h2><p>The smell of Coppertone sunscreen. The satisfying snap of a View-Master lever. The weight of a metal Tonka truck in your hands, its yellow paint already chipping from use. Your childhood had a heft that plastic couldn't replicate—everything was built to last, to survive being thrown down basement stairs.</p><p>At four, you were watching Captain Kangaroo and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, shows that moved at a pace that would bore modern kids to tears. By six, you'd graduated to The Flintstones in primetime and Lost in Space with its cardboard sets and serious dialogue about survival. Saturday mornings were sacred—Scooby-Doo, Jonny Quest, and The Jetsons promising a future of flying cars and robot maids that still hasn't arrived.</p><p>Your toys told a story. Etch A Sketch arrived when you were two, and you spent hours creating stairs nobody asked for. GI Joe showed up in 1964, twelve inches of poseable adventure. Easy-Bake Oven in 1963, baking tiny cakes with a lightbulb. Slot cars by 1965, and suddenly every basement needed a track. Creepy Crawlers let you burn yourself making rubber bugs. Your mother had opinions about all of this.</p><p>Dinner meant Tang, TV dinners in aluminum trays, and Swanson frozen peas that had been boiled into submission. You ate Jiffy Pop popcorn watching Bonanza, the foil dome expanding like a miracle. Kool-Aid by the gallon, grape stains on your upper lip. Tab for the adults who were already worried about weight. Nobody worried about high-fructose corn syrup yet.</p><p>At seven, you watched men walk on the moon on a television that weighed more than you did. Walter Cronkite narrated history in real-time, removing his glasses when things got serious. At nine, your mother explained Woodstock in terms vague enough to be useless. At twelve, Nixon resigned, and your father said something about never trusting politicians that stuck with you. Your childhood was bracketed by assassinations and scandals, optimism and disillusionment in rapid succession.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The term started neutral and became an accusation. You're the generation that supposedly had it all—postwar prosperity, cheap education, affordable housing—and pulled the ladder up behind you. That's the narrative, anyway. The truth is more complicated, but truth rarely trends.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were one when Kennedy was assassinated.</span> Too young to remember Camelot, but old enough to grow up in its shadow. The footage played every November of your childhood—the motorcade, the pink suit, the grassy knoll theories that never quite resolved. Your parents remembered where they were. You remember where the TV was.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans. Born at the tail end, in 1962, you're part of what some demographers call 'Generation Jones'—too young for Woodstock, too old for MTV's launch. You watched the counterculture happen from the cheap seats, then arrived just in time for its commercial afterlife.</p><p>At seven, you watched the moon landing while older Boomers were dodging the draft or protesting at Columbia. At thirteen, you watched Vietnam end on television while wearing bell-bottoms you'd actually chosen yourself. At eighteen, you voted in your first election—1980, Reagan versus Carter—while the older Boomers who'd marched on Washington were buying BMWs and discovering cocaine.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">You're the bridge generation within a generation.</span> The hippie ideal was something you inherited, not something you built. By the time you had enough money to sell out, the sellout was complete. You got the economic benefits of the boom years and the cultural hangover of the counterculture. Whether that's lucky or cursed depends on the day.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Lawrence of Arabia swept the Oscars the year you were born—Peter O'Toole crossing deserts while your mother crossed maternity wards. Dr. No introduced James Bond to American audiences. To Kill a Mockingbird taught everyone about justice while the actual civil rights movement played out on the evening news. The movies were learning to be serious.</p><p>Your actual pop culture education started with The Flintstones, which premiered in 1960 and was everywhere by the time you could understand it. The Jetsons arrived the year you were born, promising a future of robot maids and flying cars. Bewitched taught you that women had power they were expected to hide. The Addams Family made weirdness aspirational.</p><p>At two, the Beatles landed on Ed Sullivan and rewired American culture. By five, you were hearing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' whether you wanted to or not. By eight, you understood the Beach Boys were singing about a California that existed mostly in Brian Wilson's head. The Four Seasons, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye—Motown was the sound of your single-digit years.</p><p>At thirteen, you saw Jaws and were afraid to swim. At fifteen, Star Wars turned every kid into a believer. At sixteen, Saturday Night Fever made disco inescapable, and you either loved it or pretended you didn't. Grease was everywhere. The Bee Gees were everywhere. John Travolta's white suit was a lifestyle choice you may have regrettably imitated.</p><p>High school straddled the death of disco and the birth of MTV. You graduated into new wave—The Police, Talking Heads, Devo. Punk happened in New York and London; you heard about it later, maybe saw the Ramones open for someone respectable. Your musical identity formed in the collision between your parents' Beatles albums, your older siblings' Led Zeppelin, and your own uncertain embrace of synthesizers.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The rotary phone hung on your kitchen wall, its coiled cord stretched around corners for privacy that didn't exist. You memorized phone numbers because you had to—no contacts list, no redial, just your brain and a pad of paper by the phone. Long distance was expensive enough that your parents timed calls with an egg timer.</p><p>At six, you experienced color television for the first time—probably at a neighbor's house, since your family still had the black-and-white RCA. The moon landing in 1969 was still in grayscale for many families. By 1972, color had conquered most living rooms, just in time to show you Vietnam in its full brutal palette.</p><p>The pocket calculator arrived when you were in middle school—$400 in 1972 dollars, more than a month's rent. By high school, Texas Instruments had dropped the price enough that teachers had to invent new rules about when you could use them. The slide rule became a relic in real-time.</p><p>At seventeen, you saw the first personal computers at Radio Shack—the TRS-80, which enthusiasts called 'Trash-80' with affection. The Apple II in 1977, with its rainbow logo and promise of revolution. You probably didn't buy one. You probably knew someone who did, who spent weekends typing BASIC programs from magazines that rarely worked the first time.</p><p>At seventeen, the Walkman arrived and changed everything about public space. Suddenly, your music was portable, private, personal. You could soundtrack your own commute, your own walk to school, your own life. The headphones were orange foam. The batteries died constantly. You didn't care.</p><p>You were thirty-three when the World Wide Web went public. Thirty-five when Amazon sold its first book. Forty-five when the iPhone launched. You've lived through the entire digital revolution as an adult with fully formed habits and skepticism, adopting each wave with varying degrees of enthusiasm. You remember life before screens, which is either wisdom or nostalgia depending on who's asking.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>The Cuban Missile Crisis happened six months after you were born. For thirteen days in October 1962, nuclear war felt not just possible but probable. Your parents were stockpiling canned goods and discussing fallout shelters while you were learning to hold your head up. You don't remember it. They never forgot it.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At one, Kennedy was assassinated.</span> Too young for memory, but the footage played every November until you could recite the Zapruder frames. At two, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam. At four, you started school while America was fighting a war it couldn't explain and wouldn't win.</p><p>The civil rights movement was the moral drama of your childhood. At four, Selma. At five, the Watts riots on your television. At six, Martin Luther King Jr. shot in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles. The year you turned six killed a lot of hope.</p><p>At seven, you watched Apollo 11 on a television that required standing up to change channels. Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, and for one moment, all the violence and division paused. Your parents cried. You weren't sure why, but you understood something important had happened.</p><p>At eleven, the oil crisis taught you that American prosperity had foreign dependencies. Gas lines wrapped around blocks. Odd-even rationing based on license plates. Your father talked about carburetors with new urgency. At twelve, Nixon resigned. Your civics teacher wasn't sure how to explain a president being a criminal. Neither was anyone else.</p><p>At seventeen, Three Mile Island melted down. At eighteen, the Iran hostage crisis began. At eighteen, Reagan was elected, beginning a political era that would define the next four decades. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. At twenty-seven, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Cold War anxiety of your entire childhood finally resolved. You'd spent your whole life practicing for a nuclear war that never came. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you watched the towers fall.</span></p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's establish the baseline you entered. 1984. Reagan's America. The postwar consensus was being disassembled while you were writing your first resume. Unions were being broken. Regulations were being stripped. The rules your parents played by were being rewritten, and nobody asked your permission.</p><p>Your parents' career looked like this: get a job after high school or college, stay thirty years, get a pension, retire with dignity. Yours: get a degree that costs actual money, entry-level positions requiring 'experience,' job-hop every few years because loyalty wasn't rewarded, pensions converted to 401(k)s that required you to become your own investment manager.</p><p>Still, you caught the tail end of the old system. Your first job probably came with health insurance as a given, not a luxury. Defined benefit pensions still existed, even if they were being phased out. The contract between employer and employee was fraying but hadn't yet snapped. You could still build a career at one company if you wanted to.</p><p>The 1980s were volatile—recession in '82, boom by '85. The '90s were better: Clinton-era prosperity, dot-com optimism, rising wages, low unemployment. If you played the stock market, you probably felt like a genius for a while. Everyone did.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit.</span> You had more to lose than younger workers, less time to recover, and a front-row seat to watching the system you'd worked within collapse. Your 401(k) cratered. Your home equity evaporated. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The younger colleagues getting laid off were also your potential competition when hiring resumed.</span></p><p>You're in your sixties now, navigating retirement in a landscape that looks nothing like your parents' golden years. Social Security exists but its future feels uncertain. Your savings might not be enough. The goalposts moved while you were running toward them.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when asking someone out meant calling their house and talking to their father first? When the phone cord only stretched so far, and privacy meant whispering in the hallway while your siblings pretended not to listen? When a date was dinner and a movie because those were the only options that allowed conversation?</p><p>You came of age in the aftermath of the sexual revolution. The Pill had been available for a decade. Women's liberation was reshaping expectations. By the time you were dating age in the late '70s, the rules your parents followed had been partially rewritten, but nobody had published the new rulebook. You improvised.</p><p>You met partners the analog way—through friends, at parties, in college dining halls, at work before HR made that complicated. You couldn't Google someone before a date. You had to actually show up and discover who they were in real-time, reading social cues without the benefit of their entire digital history.</p><p>Your generation married later than your parents but earlier than your kids would. The average first marriage for your cohort was mid-twenties. Divorce lost its stigma; cohabitation became acceptable. The life script your parents followed—married by 22, kids by 25—still existed but was no longer mandatory.</p><p>Communication evolved across your lifetime in ways that would have seemed like science fiction. Landlines to answering machines to email to cell phones to smartphones. Each transition changed how relationships worked—how you stayed in touch, how you fought, how you made up. You adapted to each wave while remembering what came before.</p><p>You've watched your kids swipe through dating apps and conduct entire relationships through text messages. It seems simultaneously miraculous and hollow. You remember when connection required showing up, when long distance meant expensive phone calls and letters that took days to arrive. The convenience is obvious. What's been lost is harder to name.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial education came from contradiction. Your parents survived the Depression and preached frugality like gospel. Then you watched inflation eat their savings in the 1970s—the very savings they'd told you were essential. Then you watched the stock market make everyone rich in the '90s. Then you watched it crash. Twice.</p><p>The numbers tell the story. When your parents were buying houses, a median home cost roughly two years of median income. By the time you were buying, in the mid-1980s, it was three years. Still manageable. Now it's six. The house your parents bought for <span class=\"stat-box\">$18,000</span> in 1965 was worth <span class=\"stat-box\">$80,000</span> when you bought yours. It's worth <span class=\"stat-box\">$600,000</span> now.</p><p>You probably have complicated feelings about wealth accumulation, and you should. You worked hard. You saved. You made reasonable decisions based on available information. But you also had opportunities that simply don't exist anymore. Your children cannot buy houses the way you did, at the prices you paid, with the wages available to entry-level workers. The math changed.</p><p>Retirement planning has dominated your financial anxiety since the 401(k) replaced the pension. The shift moved all the risk onto you—investment decisions, market timing, longevity calculations. Social Security became a political football. You've saved and hoped it would be enough, never quite certain the rules wouldn't change before you got there.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Your relationship with money is shaped by watching cycles repeat.</span> The oil shocks of the '70s, the stagflation, the 1987 crash, the dot-com bust, 2008—each one taught the same lesson: the floor can disappear without warning. <span class=\"pull-quote\">You save compulsively because you've seen what happens when you don't.</span> You worry about running out even when the math suggests you won't.</p><p>Estate planning is the final financial decision. What happens to what you've accumulated? Who benefits? When? These questions are more complicated than your parents' generation faced—tax law, family dynamics, the reality that helping adult children now might matter more than leaving them money later. The answers aren't obvious.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your biggest blind spot is mistaking your experience for normal rather than historically anomalous. You grew up in the most prosperous period in American history—postwar expansion, cheap energy, rising wages, affordable housing, upward mobility that actually functioned. That wasn't the default. That was an exception. The exception ended.</p><p>You tend to believe hard work leads to success because, for your generation, the correlation was real. The problem is assuming causation when timing deserves most of the credit. When you tell younger people to 'just work harder' or 'stop buying lattes,' you're prescribing solutions for problems they don't have.</p><p>The advice that worked for you—buy a house early, stay at one company, invest in index funds—assumes conditions that no longer exist. Houses cost six times the median income. Companies don't reward loyalty. Index funds help, but not when rent takes 40% of your paycheck before you can invest.</p><p>Your generation normalized certain destructions while fighting others. You marched for the environment and drove SUVs. You protested Vietnam and voted for politicians who started Iraq. You questioned authority in your twenties and wielded it without mercy in your fifties. The contradictions are visible to everyone who came after.</p><p>Technology is your complicated relationship, and you don't always know it. You adopted smartphones and social media but use them differently than younger people—more likely to share misinformation, less likely to understand how algorithms shape what you see. Digital literacy is a skill, not a generational birthright, and assumptions about who has it are often wrong.</p><p>Defensiveness about generational criticism is understandable but counterproductive. 'OK Boomer' stings because it dismisses real work and real struggle. But the frustration behind it is also real: younger generations are poorer, more precarious, and facing problems your generation's policies created or ignored. Both things can be true.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1982-1992):</strong> You started your career in Reagan's America, when the postwar rules were being rewritten. The economy was rocky early, booming later. You probably established yourself professionally, got married, maybe had kids. The Cold War was still on but winding down—Gorbachev and glasnost suggested the unthinkable might actually happen. You were young enough to believe things would keep getting better.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1992-2002):</strong> The Clinton years. The economy hummed. The dot-com bubble made everyone feel like a genius. You were in peak earning years, raising children, building wealth through rising home values and 401(k) contributions. The Berlin Wall had fallen. History had supposedly ended. Then, at thirty-nine, September 11 ended the ending, and everything that came next—Afghanistan, Iraq, the Patriot Act—was your forties' inheritance.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2002-2012):</strong> The aftermath of 9/11 defined this decade. Forever wars. The security state. Then, in 2008, the financial crisis that cratered retirement savings and proved the system was more fragile than advertised. You were established enough to survive but old enough to feel the precarity. Your kids were becoming adults in a world that offered them less than you'd had, and you were starting to notice.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2012-2022):</strong> Recovery from 2008, slow and uneven. Obama, then Trump. The culture wars intensified. Your kids were struggling in ways you didn't expect—student debt, unaffordable housing, job markets that didn't reward degrees the way yours did. Climate change became undeniable. You were thinking about retirement, wondering if you'd saved enough, watching the world change faster than you could track.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2022-2032):</strong> You're here now. Retirement age, or approaching it. A pandemic disrupted everything. Politics feels more unhinged than ever. You're navigating healthcare costs that keep rising, Social Security decisions with no clear right answers, and the question of what to do with decades of accumulated possessions. Your grandchildren are growing up in a world you barely recognize.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2032+):</strong> Seventy isn't what it used to be—you might have twenty more active years, or more. Healthcare will be your largest expense. Staying connected to family will matter more than career ever did. You'll watch technologies emerge that would have been science fiction in your childhood. You'll tell grandchildren about rotary phones and three TV channels and a world where computers filled rooms. They won't quite believe you. It'll sound like a different planet.</p>"

You're part of the Boomer generation—the largest in American history until Millennials edged past in 2019. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Your cohort controls roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American household wealth, a concentration that shapes every generational comparison.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They played by rules you questioned. They deferred to authority you challenged. They survived the Depression and won the war; you inherited the prosperity and the expectation that it would continue forever. They saved quietly; you consumed conspicuously. They gave you opportunities they'd earned through sacrifice. Whether you appreciated that while it was happening is between you and your conscience.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They entered the workforce after the good manufacturing jobs started leaving. The 'forgotten middle child' generation—smaller in numbers, less politically powerful, sandwiched between Boomers who won't retire and Millennials who get all the think pieces. They're cynical in ways you find off-putting. They think you're in denial about what you did to the economy.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> The wealth gap is the number that matters. When Boomers were their age, you controlled 21% of national wealth. They control 7%. You bought houses for three years' salary; they face houses costing six to ten. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The math is what it is, regardless of whose fault it is.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You're practically different species. They've never known a world without internet. They don't remember 9/11 as a lived experience. They came of age during pandemic and climate crisis, with economic expectations calibrated to a world that bears no resemblance to your childhood optimism. They assume systems will fail because they've only seen them fail.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've exceeded that already if you're reading this at 63. Medical advances, lifestyle improvements, and luck extended the average. Your generation will live longer than any before, which is genuinely good news, but also means retirement needs to stretch further than anyone planned for.</p>"
