      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1962-1974</h2><p>You were born the year the world almost ended. The Cuban Missile Crisis happened in October 1962, and for thirteen days, nuclear annihilation felt like a genuine possibility. Your parents were stockpiling canned goods and contemplating bomb shelters while you were learning to hold your head up. Welcome to Earth—hope it's still here tomorrow.</p><p>John F. Kennedy was president. The Space Race was on. John Glenn orbited the Earth three times the month before you were born, and suddenly going to the moon seemed like something that might actually happen. America was optimistic in a way that feels almost quaint now, all Camelot and New Frontiers and the confident belief that problems had solutions.</p><p>That optimism didn't last. You were a year old when Kennedy was assassinated. Too young to remember it, but the footage played on every anniversary of your childhood. You grew up in the shadow of that motorcade, that pink suit, that grassy knoll.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack was Vietnam on the evening news. Body counts at dinner. Protests on college campuses. The draft lottery that would determine whether young men lived or died based on their birthday. By the time you were old enough to understand, the country was tearing itself apart—over war, over civil rights, over everything.</p><p>You learned to read around the same time Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were shot. You watched the moon landing at seven years old, probably on a black-and-white TV with rabbit ears. Woodstock happened when you were seven. Nixon resigned when you were twelve. Your childhood was a masterclass in watching institutions fail in real-time.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born in the last stretch of the generation that spans 1946-1964. That's roughly 76 million Americans—the largest generation the country had ever seen until the Millennials came along to take the title and the blame.</p><p>The label comes from the post-war birth explosion. Your parents survived the Depression and won World War II, and they came home and had a lot of children in rapid succession. The economy was booming. Houses were cheap. A single income could support a family. The American Dream wasn't a cliché—it was a reasonable expectation.</p><p>Being born in 1962 puts you at the tail end of the Boom, which some demographers call 'Generation Jones'—not quite old enough to be a hippie, not quite young enough to be Gen X. You missed the Summer of Love but caught the energy crisis. You were too young for Woodstock but old enough for disco.</p><p>Your generation is famous for many things: transforming youth culture, protesting Vietnam, inventing the counterculture, and then abandoning all of it for stock options and SUVs. The hippies became yuppies. The radicals became Reagan voters. Whether that's hypocrisy or maturity depends on who's telling the story.</p><p>You grew up being told you were special, that you could change the world. And your generation did change the world—civil rights legislation, environmental protection, women's liberation. You also invented trickle-down economics, destroyed pensions, and left the next generations holding the bag on climate change. Complicated legacy.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, Marilyn Monroe died and the Beatles released their first single. In other words, Old Hollywood was closing down just as the British Invasion was warming up. Your timing was impeccable.</p><p>Lawrence of Arabia won Best Picture in 1962. Dr. No introduced James Bond to movie audiences. To Kill a Mockingbird and The Manchurian Candidate were in theaters. The movies were getting darker, more complex, less willing to pretend everything was fine.</p><p>Television in your childhood meant three networks and whatever the antenna could pull in. You probably watched The Ed Sullivan Show, Bonanza, and The Andy Griffith Show. Saturday morning cartoons were a religious ritual. The TV got turned off during dinner because that's what families did.</p><p>Musically, your consciousness awakened just in time for the most transformative decade in pop history. The Beatles landed when you were two. By the time you were old enough to choose your own music, you had Motown, the Stones, Dylan going electric, Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Doors. Your teenage years brought Led Zeppelin, Bowie, punk rock, and the birth of disco.</p><p>You were fifteen when Star Wars came out and rewired every kid's brain. You were sixteen when Saturday Night Fever made disco inescapable. Your high school years straddled the transition from arena rock to new wave, from bell-bottoms to skinny ties. The culture moved fast, and you moved with it.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born in the age of the rotary phone, the black-and-white TV, and the typewriter. The most advanced technology in your childhood home was probably the automatic transmission in your dad's car. Computers existed, but they filled entire rooms and belonged to NASA and IBM.</p><p>Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring' was published the year you were born, which eventually led to the EPA and the environmental movement. The Telstar satellite launched that summer, enabling the first live transatlantic television broadcasts. Technology was changing the world, but slowly, and mostly outside the average household.</p><p>You grew up analog in ways younger generations can't fathom. Music came on vinyl records that you handled carefully and stored vertically. Photographs required film that you dropped off and picked up a week later. Long-distance phone calls were expensive events. If you wanted to look something up, you went to the library.</p><p>The pocket calculator arrived when you were in middle school. The VCR came when you were a teenager. Personal computers started showing up when you were in your early twenties—the Apple II in 1977, the IBM PC in 1981. The Walkman arrived in 1979 and changed how people related to music in public.</p><p>You were thirty-three when the World Wide Web went public. Forty-five when the iPhone launched. You've lived through the entire arc of the digital revolution, from punch cards to smartphones. You adapted to each wave, but you also remember what life was like before screens colonized every surface.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Nuclear drills in elementary school meant hiding under desks as if plywood would protect you from atomic fire. The threat was constant, ambient, the background radiation of your entire childhood.</p><p>You were a toddler when Kennedy was killed. A year later, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam into a full-scale war. By the time you started school, American soldiers were dying daily in a jungle most people couldn't find on a map.</p><p>The civil rights movement was the moral drama of your childhood. You watched it unfold on television—fire hoses, police dogs, marches, speeches. You were six when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy. The year you turned six was brutal.</p><p>You were seven when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. That was the triumph your generation needed—proof that impossible things could be accomplished, that the future might actually be better than the present.</p><p>Vietnam ended when you were thirteen, just in time for you to miss the draft by a few years. Watergate unfolded during your middle school years, teaching you early that presidents could be criminals and institutions could be corrupt. Nixon resigned when you were twelve.</p><p>The oil crisis hit when you were eleven. Gas lines, rationing, the sudden realization that American prosperity depended on decisions made in countries most Americans couldn't pronounce. The economy sputtered. Inflation surged. The easy confidence of the postwar boom was over.</p><p>You were seventeen when Three Mile Island had its partial meltdown. Eighteen when the Iran hostage crisis began. Reagan was elected when you were eighteen, launching an era that would define American politics for the next four decades. The Cold War ended when you were in your late twenties, which probably felt like your entire childhood anxiety finally getting resolved.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the early 1980s, just as the postwar economic consensus was being dismantled. Reagan was president. Deregulation was the religion. Unions were being broken. The rules that had governed work for your parents' generation were being rewritten, mostly not in your favor.</p><p>Still, you caught the tail end of the old system. Jobs still came with pensions, or at least the expectation of pensions. Health insurance was a benefit, not a luxury. You could stay at one company for thirty years and retire with a gold watch and a defined benefit plan. That model was dying, but it wasn't dead yet.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the shift from manufacturing to services, from industry to information. The factory jobs that had built the middle class were disappearing overseas. The new economy wanted college degrees, computer skills, adaptability. You adapted because you had to.</p><p>The 1980s economy was volatile—recession early, boom later. You probably had a few different jobs before finding your footing. The '90s were better: low unemployment, rising wages, the dot-com bubble making everyone feel like a genius. If you played the market, you probably did well.</p><p>You were in your mid-career when 2008 hit. You had more to lose than younger workers and less time to recover. Your 401(k) cratered. Your house might have been underwater. You watched younger colleagues get laid off and wondered if you were next. The system you'd worked within your whole life was clearly fragile.</p><p>You're approaching retirement now, or already there, navigating a world where retirement looks nothing like what your parents had. Social Security still exists but feels uncertain. Your savings might not be enough. Working into your seventies isn't failure—it's the new normal.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which sounds more glamorous than it was. The Pill became widely available in the 1960s. Women's liberation challenged traditional gender roles. Marriage stopped being the only acceptable path to adulthood. By the time you were dating age, the rules your parents followed had been partially rewritten.</p><p>You probably met partners the old-fashioned way: through friends, at parties, in college, at work. Dating meant calling someone's house, talking to their parents, going to dinner and a movie. You couldn't Google someone before a date. You had to actually talk to them and find out who they were in real-time.</p><p>Your generation married later than your parents did, but earlier than your children would. The average first marriage for your cohort was mid-twenties. Divorce became more common and less shameful. Cohabitation before marriage became acceptable, then normal.</p><p>Communication technology changed everything, slowly and then all at once. You started with landlines and letters. Then answering machines. Then email. Then cell phones. Then smartphones. Each technology changed how relationships worked—how you kept in touch, how you met people, how you maintained connections across distance.</p><p>You've watched your kids and grandkids conduct entire relationships through screens and apps, and it probably seems both miraculous and slightly sad. You remember when talking to someone meant being in the same room, or at least holding a phone attached to a wall. The convenience is obvious. What's been lost is harder to articulate.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by contradictions. Your parents survived the Depression and taught you to save, be frugal, avoid debt. Then you watched inflation eat those savings in the 1970s. Then you watched the stock market make everyone rich in the 1990s. Then you watched it crash in 2000 and again in 2008.</p><p>You bought your first house when houses were affordable—genuinely, historically affordable. The house your parents bought for $15,000 in 1955 was worth $50,000 by the time you were buying. That same house is worth $500,000 now. You probably think of this as 'how things worked out,' but it's actually unprecedented wealth accumulation through real estate.</p><p>Your generation controls more wealth than any generation in American history. This isn't because you worked harder or smarter—it's because you happened to be buying assets when they were cheap and holding them as they appreciated. The timing was lucky. The policies that enabled it were deliberate.</p><p>You probably have complicated feelings about this. You worked hard. You saved. You made good decisions. But you also had opportunities that simply don't exist anymore. Your children can't buy houses the way you did. Your grandchildren might never own property at all. The ladder you climbed has been pulled up.</p><p>Retirement planning has been the dominant financial anxiety of your adult life. The shift from pensions to 401(k)s put the risk on you. Social Security's future became a constant political football. You've saved and invested and hoped it would be enough, never quite sure if the rules would change before you got there.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is the assumption that your experience was normal rather than historically anomalous. You grew up in the most prosperous period in American history. Jobs were plentiful. Houses were cheap. The economy grew consistently. That wasn't the default—it was an exception.</p><p>You tend to believe that hard work leads to success because, for your generation, it mostly did. The correlation was real. The problem is assuming it still applies. When you tell younger people to 'just work harder,' you're prescribing medicine that worked for a disease they don't have.</p><p>Your generation normalized certain kinds of destruction while fighting others. You marched for the environment but drove SUVs. You protested war but voted for politicians who started them. You questioned authority in the '60s and wielded it ruthlessly in the '90s. The contradictions are glaring to those who came after.</p><p>You're often defensive about generational criticism, which is understandable but not productive. Being told 'OK Boomer' stings. But the frustration behind it is real: younger generations are poorer, more precarious, and facing problems your generation created or ignored. Dismissing their anger as entitlement misses the point.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is complicated in ways you don't always recognize. You adopted smartphones and social media but often use them differently than younger people. You might share misinformation without realizing it. You might not understand how algorithms work. Digital literacy is a skill, and generational assumptions about who has it are often wrong.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1982-1992):</strong> You started your career during Reagan's America. The economy was rocky early but boomed later. You probably established yourself professionally, got married, maybe had kids. The Cold War was still on but winding down. You were young enough to still believe things would keep getting better.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1992-2002):</strong> The Clinton years. The economy was humming. The dot-com bubble made everyone feel rich. You were in your peak earning years, raising kids, building wealth. The Berlin Wall had fallen. History had ended, supposedly. 9/11 came right at the end, at thirty-nine, and changed everything.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2002-2012):</strong> The aftermath of 9/11 defined this decade. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The security state. Then, in 2008, the financial crisis that wiped out retirement savings and crashed the housing market. You were established enough to survive but old enough to feel the precarity. Your kids were becoming adults in a world that offered them less than you'd had.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2012-2022):</strong> Recovery from 2008, slow and uneven. Obama, then Trump. The culture wars got louder. Your kids were struggling in ways you didn't expect. Climate change became undeniable. You were thinking about retirement, wondering if you'd saved enough, watching the world change in ways that felt disorienting.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2022-2032):</strong> You're here now. Retirement age, or approaching it. The pandemic disrupted everything. Politics feels more unhinged than ever. You're navigating healthcare costs, Social Security decisions, what to do with decades of accumulated stuff. Your grandchildren are growing up in a world you barely recognize.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2032+):</strong> The goal posts keep moving. Seventy isn't what it used to be—you might have twenty more years, or more. Healthcare will be your biggest expense. Staying connected to family will matter more than anything. You'll watch technologies emerge that would have seemed like science fiction when you were young. You'll tell stories about a world without internet, without smartphones, without constant connection. Some things will be better. Some will be worse. That's always how it goes.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.1 million Americans born in 1962. The entire Baby Boom generation is about 76 million people, making it the largest generation in American history until Millennials edged past.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you had more freedom, more opportunities, and more economic prosperity. They followed rules; you questioned them. They saved quietly; you consumed conspicuously. They deferred to authority; you challenged it, at least when you were young.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had it easier economically but harder culturally. Gen X entered the workforce after the good jobs started disappearing. They're the 'forgotten middle child' generation—smaller in numbers, less politically powerful, perpetually overshadowed by Boomers ahead and Millennials behind.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. You bought houses when they cost two years' salary; Millennials face houses that cost ten years' salary. You had pensions; they have debt. You controlled 21% of the nation's wealth at their age; they control 7%.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're practically different species. They've never known a world without internet. They don't remember 9/11. They came of age during pandemic and climate crisis. Their expectations are calibrated to a world that bears little resemblance to the one you grew up in.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've already exceeded that if you're reading this at 62 or older. Medical advances extended lifespans; lifestyle improvements helped too. Your generation will live longer than any before, which is good, but also means retirement needs to stretch further than anyone planned.</p>"
