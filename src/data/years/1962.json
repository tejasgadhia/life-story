      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1962-1974</h2><p>The smell of Coppertone sunscreen. The satisfying snap of a View-Master lever. The weight of a metal Tonka truck in small hands, its yellow paint already chipping from use. Childhood had a heft that plastic couldn't replicate—everything was built to last, to survive being thrown down basement stairs.</p><p>At four, children were watching Captain Kangaroo and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, shows that moved at a pace that would bore modern kids to tears. By six, they'd graduated to The Flintstones in primetime and Lost in Space with its cardboard sets and serious dialogue about survival. Saturday mornings were sacred—Scooby-Doo, Jonny Quest, and The Jetsons promising a future of flying cars and robot maids that still hasn't arrived.</p><p>Toys told a story. Etch A Sketch arrived when children were two, and they spent hours creating stairs nobody asked for. GI Joe showed up in 1964, twelve inches of poseable adventure. Easy-Bake Oven in 1963, baking tiny cakes with a lightbulb. Slot cars by 1965, and suddenly every basement needed a track. Creepy Crawlers let children burn themselves making rubber bugs. Mothers had opinions about all of this.</p><p>Dinner meant Tang, TV dinners in aluminum trays, and Swanson frozen peas that had been boiled into submission. Jiffy Pop popcorn while watching Bonanza, the foil dome expanding like a miracle. Kool-Aid by the gallon, grape stains on upper lips. Tab for the adults who were already worried about weight. Nobody worried about high-fructose corn syrup yet.</p><p>At seven, children watched men walk on the moon on a television that weighed more than they did. Walter Cronkite narrated history in real-time, removing his glasses when things got serious. At nine, mothers explained Woodstock in terms vague enough to be useless. At twelve, Nixon resigned, and fathers said something about never trusting politicians that stuck with them. Childhood was bracketed by assassinations and scandals, optimism and disillusionment in rapid succession.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. The term started neutral and became an accusation. This generation supposedly had it all—postwar prosperity, cheap education, affordable housing—and pulled the ladder up behind them. That's the narrative, anyway. The truth is more complicated, but truth rarely trends.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Those born in 1962 were one when Kennedy was assassinated.</span> Too young to remember Camelot, but old enough to grow up in its shadow. The footage played every November of their childhood—the motorcade, the pink suit, the grassy knoll theories that never quite resolved. Parents remembered where they were. Children remember where the TV was.</p><p>This generation spans 1946 to 1964—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans. Born at the tail end, in 1962, this cohort is part of what some demographers call 'Generation Jones'—too young for Woodstock, too old for MTV's launch. They watched the counterculture happen from the cheap seats, then arrived just in time for its commercial afterlife.</p><p>At seven, they watched the moon landing while older Boomers were dodging the draft or protesting at Columbia. At thirteen, they watched Vietnam end on television while wearing bell-bottoms they'd actually chosen themselves. At eighteen, they voted in their first election—1980, Reagan versus Carter—while the older Boomers who'd marched on Washington were buying BMWs and discovering cocaine.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">They're the bridge generation within a generation.</span> The hippie ideal was something they inherited, not something they built. By the time they had enough money to sell out, the sellout was complete. They got the economic benefits of the boom years and the cultural hangover of the counterculture. Whether that's lucky or cursed depends on the day.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Lawrence of Arabia swept the Oscars the year this cohort was born—Peter O'Toole crossing deserts while mothers crossed maternity wards. Dr. No introduced James Bond to American audiences. To Kill a Mockingbird taught everyone about justice while the actual civil rights movement played out on the evening news. The movies were learning to be serious.</p><p>The pop culture education started with The Flintstones, which premiered in 1960 and was everywhere by the time children could understand it. The Jetsons arrived the year they were born, promising a future of robot maids and flying cars. Bewitched taught that women had power they were expected to hide. The Addams Family made weirdness aspirational.</p><p>At two, the Beatles landed on Ed Sullivan and rewired American culture. By five, children were hearing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' whether they wanted to or not. By eight, they understood the Beach Boys were singing about a California that existed mostly in Brian Wilson's head. The Four Seasons, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye—Motown was the sound of single-digit years.</p><p>At thirteen, they saw Jaws and were afraid to swim. At fifteen, Star Wars turned every kid into a believer. At sixteen, Saturday Night Fever made disco inescapable, and they either loved it or pretended they didn't. Grease was everywhere. The Bee Gees were everywhere. John Travolta's white suit was a lifestyle choice they may have regrettably imitated.</p><p>High school straddled the death of disco and the birth of MTV. They graduated into new wave—The Police, Talking Heads, Devo. Punk happened in New York and London; they heard about it later, maybe saw the Ramones open for someone respectable. Musical identity formed in the collision between parents' Beatles albums, older siblings' Led Zeppelin, and their own uncertain embrace of synthesizers.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The rotary phone hung on kitchen walls, its coiled cord stretched around corners for privacy that didn't exist. Phone numbers were memorized because there was no other option—no contacts list, no redial, just memory and a pad of paper by the phone. Long distance was expensive enough that parents timed calls with an egg timer.</p><p>At six, children experienced color television for the first time—probably at a neighbor's house, since many families still had the black-and-white RCA. The moon landing in 1969 was still in grayscale for many families. By 1972, color had conquered most living rooms, just in time to show Vietnam in its full brutal palette.</p><p>The pocket calculator arrived during middle school—$400 in 1972 dollars, more than a month's rent. By high school, Texas Instruments had dropped the price enough that teachers had to invent new rules about when they could be used. The slide rule became a relic in real-time.</p><p>At seventeen, they saw the first personal computers at Radio Shack—the TRS-80, which enthusiasts called 'Trash-80' with affection. The Apple II in 1977, with its rainbow logo and promise of revolution. They probably didn't buy one. They probably knew someone who did, who spent weekends typing BASIC programs from magazines that rarely worked the first time.</p><p>At seventeen, the Walkman arrived and changed everything about public space. Suddenly, music was portable, private, personal. They could soundtrack their own commute, their own walk to school, their own life. The headphones were orange foam. The batteries died constantly. They didn't care.</p><p>This cohort was thirty-three when the World Wide Web went public. Thirty-five when Amazon sold its first book. Forty-five when the iPhone launched. They've lived through the entire digital revolution as adults with fully formed habits and skepticism, adopting each wave with varying degrees of enthusiasm. They remember life before screens, which is either wisdom or nostalgia depending on who's asking.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>The Cuban Missile Crisis happened six months after this cohort was born. For thirteen days in October 1962, nuclear war felt not just possible but probable. Parents were stockpiling canned goods and discussing fallout shelters while children were learning to hold their heads up. Children don't remember it. Parents never forgot it.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At one, Kennedy was assassinated.</span> Too young for memory, but the footage played every November until they could recite the Zapruder frames. At two, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam. At four, they started school while America was fighting a war it couldn't explain and wouldn't win.</p><p>The civil rights movement was the moral drama of childhood. At four, Selma. At five, the Watts riots on television. At six, Martin Luther King Jr. shot in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles. The year they turned six killed a lot of hope.</p><p>At seven, they watched Apollo 11 on a television that required standing up to change channels. Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, and for one moment, all the violence and division paused. Parents cried. Children weren't sure why, but they understood something important had happened.</p><p>At eleven, the oil crisis taught that American prosperity had foreign dependencies. Gas lines wrapped around blocks. Odd-even rationing based on license plates. Fathers talked about carburetors with new urgency. At twelve, Nixon resigned. Civics teachers weren't sure how to explain a president being a criminal. Neither was anyone else.</p><p>At seventeen, Three Mile Island melted down. At eighteen, the Iran hostage crisis began. At eighteen, Reagan was elected, beginning a political era that would define the next four decades. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. At twenty-seven, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Cold War anxiety of their entire childhood finally resolved. They'd spent their whole life practicing for a nuclear war that never came. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, they watched the towers fall.</span></p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The baseline this cohort entered: 1984. Reagan's America. The postwar consensus was being disassembled while they were writing their first resume. Unions were being broken. Regulations were being stripped. The rules their parents played by were being rewritten.</p><p>Parents' careers looked like this: get a job after high school or college, stay thirty years, get a pension, retire with dignity. This cohort's path: get a degree that costs actual money, entry-level positions requiring 'experience,' job-hop every few years because loyalty wasn't rewarded, pensions converted to 401(k)s that required becoming their own investment manager.</p><p>Still, they caught the tail end of the old system. Their first job probably came with health insurance as a given, not a luxury. Defined benefit pensions still existed, even if they were being phased out. The contract between employer and employee was fraying but hadn't yet snapped. They could still build a career at one company if they wanted to.</p><p>The 1980s were volatile—recession in '82, boom by '85. The '90s were better: Clinton-era prosperity, dot-com optimism, rising wages, low unemployment. If they played the stock market, they probably felt like a genius for a while. Everyone did.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit.</span> This cohort had more to lose than younger workers, less time to recover, and a front-row seat to watching the system they'd worked within collapse. Their 401(k)s cratered. Their home equity evaporated. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The younger colleagues getting laid off were also their potential competition when hiring resumed.</span></p><p>They're in their sixties now, navigating retirement in a landscape that looks nothing like their parents' golden years. Social Security exists but its future feels uncertain. Their savings might not be enough. The goalposts moved while they were running toward them.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Asking someone out meant calling their house and talking to their father first. The phone cord only stretched so far, and privacy meant whispering in the hallway while siblings pretended not to listen. A date was dinner and a movie because those were the only options that allowed conversation.</p><p>This generation came of age in the aftermath of the sexual revolution. The Pill had been available for a decade. Women's liberation was reshaping expectations. By the time they were dating age in the late '70s, the rules their parents followed had been partially rewritten, but nobody had published the new rulebook. They improvised.</p><p>They met partners the analog way—through friends, at parties, in college dining halls, at work before HR made that complicated. They couldn't Google someone before a date. They had to actually show up and discover who they were in real-time, reading social cues without the benefit of their entire digital history.</p><p>This generation married later than their parents but earlier than their kids would. The average first marriage for this cohort was mid-twenties. Divorce lost its stigma; cohabitation became acceptable. The life script their parents followed—married by 22, kids by 25—still existed but was no longer mandatory.</p><p>Communication evolved across their lifetime in ways that would have seemed like science fiction. Landlines to answering machines to email to cell phones to smartphones. Each transition changed how relationships worked—how they stayed in touch, how they fought, how they made up. They adapted to each wave while remembering what came before.</p><p>They've watched their kids swipe through dating apps and conduct entire relationships through text messages. It seems simultaneously miraculous and hollow. They remember when connection required showing up, when long distance meant expensive phone calls and letters that took days to arrive. The convenience is obvious. What's been lost is harder to name.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Financial education came from contradiction. Parents survived the Depression and preached frugality like gospel. Then this cohort watched inflation eat their parents' savings in the 1970s—the very savings they'd been told were essential. Then they watched the stock market make everyone rich in the '90s. Then they watched it crash. Twice.</p><p>The numbers tell the story. When parents were buying houses, a median home cost roughly two years of median income. By the time this cohort was buying, in the mid-1980s, it was three years. Still manageable. Now it's six. The house parents bought for <span class=\"stat-box\">$18,000</span> in 1965 was worth <span class=\"stat-box\">$80,000</span> when this cohort bought theirs. It's worth <span class=\"stat-box\">$600,000</span> now.</p><p>This cohort probably has complicated feelings about wealth accumulation, and they should. They worked hard. They saved. They made reasonable decisions based on available information. But they also had opportunities that simply don't exist anymore. Their children cannot buy houses the way they did, at the prices they paid, with the wages available to entry-level workers. The math changed.</p><p>Retirement planning has dominated financial anxiety since the 401(k) replaced the pension. The shift moved all the risk onto workers—investment decisions, market timing, longevity calculations. Social Security became a political football. They've saved and hoped it would be enough, never quite certain the rules wouldn't change before they got there.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Their relationship with money is shaped by watching cycles repeat.</span> The oil shocks of the '70s, the stagflation, the 1987 crash, the dot-com bust, 2008—each one taught the same lesson: the floor can disappear without warning. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They save compulsively because they've seen what happens when they don't.</span> They worry about running out even when the math suggests they won't.</p><p>Estate planning is the final financial decision. What happens to what they've accumulated? Who benefits? When? These questions are more complicated than their parents' generation faced—tax law, family dynamics, the reality that helping adult children now might matter more than leaving them money later. The answers aren't obvious.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This cohort's biggest blind spot is mistaking their experience for normal rather than historically anomalous. They grew up in the most prosperous period in American history—postwar expansion, cheap energy, rising wages, affordable housing, upward mobility that actually functioned. That wasn't the default. That was an exception. The exception ended.</p><p>They tend to believe hard work leads to success because, for their generation, the correlation was real. The problem is assuming causation when timing deserves most of the credit. When they tell younger people to 'just work harder' or 'stop buying lattes,' they're prescribing solutions for problems they don't have.</p><p>The advice that worked for them—buy a house early, stay at one company, invest in index funds—assumes conditions that no longer exist. Houses cost six times the median income. Companies don't reward loyalty. Index funds help, but not when rent takes 40% of a paycheck before anyone can invest.</p><p>This generation normalized certain destructions while fighting others. They marched for the environment and drove SUVs. They protested Vietnam and voted for politicians who started Iraq. They questioned authority in their twenties and wielded it without mercy in their fifties. The contradictions are visible to everyone who came after.</p><p>Technology is their complicated relationship, and they don't always know it. They adopted smartphones and social media but use them differently than younger people—more likely to share misinformation, less likely to understand how algorithms shape what they see. Digital literacy is a skill, not a generational birthright, and assumptions about who has it are often wrong.</p><p>Defensiveness about generational criticism is understandable but counterproductive. 'OK Boomer' stings because it dismisses real work and real struggle. But the frustration behind it is also real: younger generations are poorer, more precarious, and facing problems this generation's policies created or ignored. Both things can be true.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Their 20s (1982-1992):</strong> They started their career in Reagan's America, when the postwar rules were being rewritten. The economy was rocky early, booming later. They probably established themselves professionally, got married, maybe had kids. The Cold War was still on but winding down—Gorbachev and glasnost suggested the unthinkable might actually happen. They were young enough to believe things would keep getting better.</p><p><strong>Their 30s (1992-2002):</strong> The Clinton years. The economy hummed. The dot-com bubble made everyone feel like a genius. They were in peak earning years, raising children, building wealth through rising home values and 401(k) contributions. The Berlin Wall had fallen. History had supposedly ended. Then, at thirty-nine, September 11 ended the ending, and everything that came next—Afghanistan, Iraq, the Patriot Act—was their forties' inheritance.</p><p><strong>Their 40s (2002-2012):</strong> The aftermath of 9/11 defined this decade. Forever wars. The security state. Then, in 2008, the financial crisis that cratered retirement savings and proved the system was more fragile than advertised. They were established enough to survive but old enough to feel the precarity. Their kids were becoming adults in a world that offered them less than they'd had, and they were starting to notice.</p><p><strong>Their 50s (2012-2022):</strong> Recovery from 2008, slow and uneven. Obama, then Trump. The culture wars intensified. Their kids were struggling in ways they didn't expect—student debt, unaffordable housing, job markets that didn't reward degrees the way theirs did. Climate change became undeniable. They were thinking about retirement, wondering if they'd saved enough, watching the world change faster than they could track.</p><p><strong>Their 60s (2022-2032):</strong> They're here now. Retirement age, or approaching it. A pandemic disrupted everything. Politics feels more unhinged than ever. They're navigating healthcare costs that keep rising, Social Security decisions with no clear right answers, and the question of what to do with decades of accumulated possessions. Their grandchildren are growing up in a world they barely recognize.</p><p><strong>Their 70s and beyond (2032+):</strong> Seventy isn't what it used to be—they might have twenty more active years, or more. Healthcare will be their largest expense. Staying connected to family will matter more than career ever did. They'll watch technologies emerge that would have been science fiction in their childhood. They'll tell grandchildren about rotary phones and three TV channels and a world where computers filled rooms. They won't quite believe them. It'll sound like a different planet.</p>"

This cohort is part of the Boomer generation—the largest in American history until Millennials edged past in 2019. <span class=\"hero-callout\">This cohort controls roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American household wealth, a concentration that shapes every generational comparison.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They played by rules Boomers questioned. They deferred to authority Boomers challenged. They survived the Depression and won the war; Boomers inherited the prosperity and the expectation that it would continue forever. They saved quietly; Boomers consumed conspicuously. They gave Boomers opportunities they'd earned through sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Gen X entered the workforce after the good manufacturing jobs started leaving. The 'forgotten middle child' generation—smaller in numbers, less politically powerful, sandwiched between Boomers who won't retire and Millennials who get all the think pieces. They're cynical in ways Boomers find off-putting.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> The wealth gap is the number that matters. When Boomers were their age, Boomers controlled 21% of national wealth. Millennials control 7%. Boomers bought houses for three years' salary; Millennials face houses costing six to ten. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The math is what it is, regardless of whose fault it is.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They're practically different species. Gen Z has never known a world without internet. They don't remember 9/11 as a lived experience. They came of age during pandemic and climate crisis, with economic expectations calibrated to a world that bears no resemblance to Boomer childhood optimism. They assume systems will fail because they've only seen them fail.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. This cohort has exceeded that already if reading this at 63. Medical advances, lifestyle improvements, and luck extended the average. This generation will live longer than any before, which is genuinely good news, but also means retirement needs to stretch further than anyone planned for.</p>"
