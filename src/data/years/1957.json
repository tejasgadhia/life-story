      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1957-1969</h2><p>You were born the year Sputnik beeped its way across the sky and made every American parent suddenly concerned about math education. The Space Age began with a four-inch metal ball launched by the Soviets, and the United States responded by panicking, then funding NASA, then spending the next twelve years trying to catch up.</p><p>Eisenhower was president when you arrived, a grandfather figure who played golf and warned about the military-industrial complex on his way out the door. By the time you started kindergarten, JFK was in the White House, promising to put a man on the moon before the decade ended. He didn't live to see it. Neither did Bobby Kennedy or Martin Luther King Jr. Your childhood was punctuated by assassinations.</p><p>The suburban dream was in full bloom. Tract housing. Station wagons. Father Knows Best. Your mother probably didn't work outside the home, and if she did, nobody talked about it. The world was supposed to be simple: America was good, Communism was bad, and if you hid under your desk during a nuclear drill, everything would be fine.</p><p>Television was the new hearth. You grew up with three channels, no remote, and whatever Walter Cronkite said was gospel. You watched the moon landing at twelve years old, probably crowded around a black-and-white TV with your family, watching grainy footage of Neil Armstrong take that first step. It felt like the future had arrived.</p><p>By the time you hit your teens, the '60s had gone from Camelot to chaos. Vietnam was on the nightly news, body counts reported like sports scores. The counterculture was in full swing—hippies, protests, drugs, rock and roll. You were too young to be drafted but old enough to watch your older cousins and neighbors get their numbers called.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the post-WWII spike in births—soldiers came home, got married, and had kids in unprecedented numbers. Your cohort is roughly 76 million Americans, the largest generation in history until Millennials edged past you.</p><p>The defining experiences for your generation were the assassinations, Vietnam, and the social upheaval of the 1960s. You watched the country tear itself apart over civil rights, women's liberation, and whether young men should die in Southeast Asian jungles. You either protested the war or enlisted; there wasn't much middle ground.</p><p>Your generation entered adulthood with extraordinary advantages. College was affordable—a summer job could pay for a year's tuition. Houses cost three times the average salary, not ten. Jobs came with pensions. The economy was growing, unions were strong, and the American Dream was actually attainable if you showed up and worked.</p><p>You've been called the 'Me Generation' since the 1970s, when Tom Wolfe coined the term. Critics say you pulled the ladder up behind you—benefiting from social programs and economic policies, then voting to dismantle them. Defenders say you fought for civil rights, feminism, and environmental protection. Both things can be true.</p><p>You're now the oldest living generation with significant political and economic power. You control most of the nation's wealth, hold most of the leadership positions, and vote in higher numbers than any other age group. What you do with that power in your remaining years will shape the country your grandchildren inherit.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year The Cat in the Hat was published. Dr. Seuss handed parents a book that actually entertained kids instead of lecturing them, and children's literature was never quite the same. That same year, On the Road hit shelves, setting the template for Beat Generation wanderlust that would echo through the counterculture you'd grow up in.</p><p>Musically, 1957 was transitional. Elvis was already king—'Jailhouse Rock' came out that year. Jerry Lee Lewis was pounding piano keys. Little Richard was screaming. Buddy Holly was about to have a very short career and a very long legacy. Rock and roll was still scandalous, and your parents probably hated it.</p><p>Your childhood television was Leave It to Beaver, American Bandstand, and The Mickey Mouse Club. Westerns dominated primetime—Gunsmoke, Have Gun – Will Travel, Wagon Train. The good guys wore white hats and always won. The bad guys were obviously bad. Moral ambiguity hadn't been invented yet.</p><p>By your teenage years, the Beatles had invaded, Dylan had gone electric, and the Stones were providing the soundtrack for rebellion. You probably remember exactly where you were when you first heard 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' You definitely remember Woodstock, whether you went or just wished you had.</p><p>Movies of your formative years ranged from The Sound of Music to Easy Rider, from wholesome musicals to countercultural manifestos. 2001: A Space Odyssey came out when you were eleven, bending your mind about what film could do. The Graduate arrived when you were ten, capturing anxieties about conformity and the future that would define your generation's coming of age.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the USSR launched Sputnik, and the technological competition that defined your childhood was the Space Race. Every rocket launch was front-page news. Every failure was a national embarrassment. Every success was proof that America was still number one. You were twelve when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, the culmination of a decade's obsession.</p><p>The technology of your childhood was nuclear anxiety. Bomb shelters, radiation drills, Civil Defense sirens. The Atoms for Peace program promised that nuclear energy would make electricity too cheap to meter. It didn't. But the fear was real, a background hum of existential dread you probably didn't fully process until later.</p><p>Television went from novelty to necessity during your lifetime. You grew up with rabbit ears and three channels. Color TV arrived when you were around ten, transforming the world from grayscale to Technicolor. By the time you were a teenager, watching TV was as natural as breathing—which is why the images of Vietnam were so devastating.</p><p>You entered the workforce before personal computers. Your first job involved typewriters, carbon paper, and memos that physically traveled through interoffice mail. You adapted to each technological wave: word processors, fax machines, email, the internet, smartphones. You're not a digital native, but you've learned every platform that came along.</p><p>This makes you the generation that experienced the most dramatic technological shift in human history. You were born closer to the Wright Brothers' first flight than to today. You went from party lines and rotary phones to video calls with grandchildren on the other side of the world. No generation before or since will span that kind of change.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the Little Rock Nine crisis—nine Black students integrating Central High School while the Arkansas National Guard tried to keep them out and President Eisenhower sent federal troops to escort them in. The civil rights movement was the moral struggle of your childhood, and it was happening on your television screen.</p><p>You were six when JFK was assassinated. If you're American and of a certain age, you remember where you were. The principal came over the intercom. Adults cried openly. The country watched a funeral on live TV and wondered if the world was ending.</p><p>You were eleven when Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were killed within two months of each other in 1968. You were twelve during the Moon landing. Fourteen when the Kent State shootings brought the Vietnam War home. Seventeen during Watergate, when you watched a president resign in disgrace. History came at you fast.</p><p>Vietnam was the war of your generation. The draft loomed over every young man's future. You either served, protested, or found a way out—college deferment, medical exemption, conscientious objector status, Canada. It divided families and ended friendships. The scars lasted decades.</p><p>You were in your twenties during the oil crisis and stagflation, watching the economic certainties of your childhood crumble. You were thirty when Reagan was elected, promising morning in America. You were forty-four during 9/11, established enough in your career to weather the aftermath but old enough to remember when airports were friendly places.</p><p>By now, you've lived through the Cold War, Vietnam, Watergate, AIDS, the Gulf War, 9/11, the Great Recession, and COVID-19. You've watched America go from undisputed superpower to something more complicated. The arc of your life tracks the arc of American empire—rise, peak, and whatever this is now.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the mid-to-late 1970s, a lousy time economically—stagflation, oil shocks, malaise. But even in a bad economy, the fundamentals were sound. Entry-level jobs existed. Companies hired and trained people. A college degree, if you had one, meant something. If you didn't, union jobs still paid middle-class wages.</p><p>You're probably the last generation to experience genuine job security. Your employer might have had a pension plan. Your health insurance was probably decent. The idea of staying at one company for thirty years wasn't naive—it was normal. Layoffs happened, but they were tragedies, not standard operating procedure.</p><p>You climbed the ladder when the ladder still existed. You worked your way up from entry-level to middle management to senior positions because that's how careers worked. Promotions came with raises, not just new titles. Your peak earning years coincided with the boom times of the '80s and '90s, when the economy rewarded people who showed up and stuck around.</p><p>If you went into business, you probably benefited from deregulation, tax cuts, and the longest bull market in history. If you went into a profession—medicine, law, engineering—you built a career when those fields were still respected and well-compensated. You accumulated assets when assets were cheap.</p><p>You're now approaching or in retirement, which is a concept your children might not recognize. You might have a pension. You probably have a house that's worth vastly more than you paid for it. You have Social Security benefits that younger generations aren't sure they'll ever see. The deal you got is the deal that got pulled from the table.</p>"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which was less a revolution and more a gradual lifting of restrictions that had governed behavior for generations. The Pill became widely available when you were a teenager. Premarital sex went from scandal to normal. Cohabitation before marriage stopped being shameful.</p><p>You probably got married younger than your children did—average age at first marriage in 1980 was 22 for women and 25 for men, compared to 28 and 30 today. You might have divorced, too. Your generation normalized divorce after centuries of it being rare and stigmatized. Whether that's progress or tragedy depends on who you ask.</p><p>Your relationship with communication technology is interesting. You grew up with handwritten letters and long-distance phone calls that cost real money. You adapted to answering machines, then voicemail, then email, then texting. You can write a proper letter and send a text, which makes you bilingual in a way younger people aren't.</p><p>You probably have complicated feelings about how your children and grandchildren date. The apps, the texting, the casual approach to commitment—it's foreign. But then again, your parents probably had complicated feelings about drive-in movies and going steady. Every generation thinks the next one is doing romance wrong.</p><p>Your friendships were forged before social media, which means they required actual effort to maintain. You called people. You visited. You wrote letters. Your address book was a physical object, and losing it was a genuine crisis. The friends you've kept for fifty years are friends because you chose to keep them, not because an algorithm kept serving them up.</p>"
    },
    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by parents who survived the Depression. They saved compulsively, paid cash for everything, and treated debt like a moral failing. You inherited some of that caution, even as the economy encouraged borrowing. Credit cards arrived when you were in your twenties. The idea of buying now and paying later was novel.</p><p>You benefited from timing more than any generation in American history. You bought houses when they cost two or three times the average salary. You invested in the stock market during the greatest bull run ever. You accumulated wealth while taxes on high earners dropped and asset prices climbed. The math just worked in your favor.</p><p>Your pension—if you have one—is a relic. Defined benefit plans that guaranteed retirement income have been replaced by 401(k)s that shift all the risk to workers. You might be among the last Americans to retire with genuine security, knowing that your monthly check will arrive regardless of what the market does.</p><p>The housing wealth is particularly significant. You bought when prices were low and sold when they were high. Or you held, and watched your equity multiply while your children struggled to afford rent. The intergenerational wealth transfer is happening, but it's going slowly, and some of your kids are hitting middle age still waiting.</p><p>You've been accused of pulling up the ladder behind you—voting for tax cuts that benefited you, opposing policies that would help younger generations. Maybe that's fair. Maybe you just voted your interests like everyone does. The result is the same: you got a deal that's no longer on offer, and explaining that to your grandchildren is awkward.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is assuming your experience was normal rather than historically exceptional. The post-WWII economy that launched your careers was an anomaly—a unique convergence of American manufacturing dominance, strong unions, high taxes on the wealthy, and government investment in infrastructure. That world doesn't exist anymore, but you sometimes talk as if it does.</p><p>You tend to give advice based on conditions that no longer apply. 'Walk in and ask for a job.' 'A firm handshake makes all the difference.' 'Just work hard and you'll get ahead.' These things were true when you entered the workforce. They're not true now. The disconnect frustrates younger people who feel like you're judging them for failing in a game with different rules.</p><p>There's a tendency to underestimate how much harder things have gotten. College costs have risen 1,200% since you enrolled. Housing costs have outpaced wages for forty years. Healthcare, childcare, and elder care consume ever-larger portions of household budgets. When you say 'I managed on a single income,' you're leaving out that a single income went further.</p><p>Your generation struggled with racial reckoning. You grew up in segregated spaces, even if you didn't notice. The progress you witnessed—civil rights legislation, integration, a Black president—can make it seem like the work is done. It isn't. The systems that created inequality weren't fully dismantled; they just got more subtle.</p><p>The climate crisis is another blind spot. Your generation built the carbon-intensive economy, enjoyed its benefits, and will largely not be around for the worst consequences. The urgency younger people feel about environmental destruction can seem overblown to someone who won't live to see Miami underwater. But your grandchildren will.</p>"

    "life_roadmap": {
      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1977-1987):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation and disco. The economy was rough, but jobs existed. You probably married younger than your children would. You bought your first car, maybe your first house. The hostage crisis and gas lines were annoyances, not catastrophes. Reagan arrived promising optimism, and for a while, it felt earned.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1987-1997):</strong> This was your building decade. Career advancement, family formation, asset accumulation. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War ended. The economy boomed. If you invested in stocks, you made money. If you bought real estate, you made more. The anxieties of your youth seemed quaint. America won, and you were American.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1997-2007):</strong> Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. Your kids were teenagers, which was its own crisis. The internet arrived and changed everything, but you were established enough to adapt without starting over. You watched the dot-com bubble inflate and burst. You were forty-four on 9/11, old enough to process it and young enough to live with the aftermath.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2007-2017):</strong> The Great Recession hit when you were fifty-one. If you were close to retirement, your timeline got pushed back. If your house was your nest egg, you watched it lose half its value. Recovery came, but it came slowly, and for some of your peers, it didn't come at all. You started thinking seriously about how many working years you had left.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2017-2027):</strong> You're here now, or just past it. Retirement is either happening or already happened. Your health is increasingly top of mind. You're watching friends deal with cancer, heart disease, cognitive decline. COVID was a genuine threat to your cohort—more deadly for your age group than for your children's. You're thinking about legacy, about what you'll leave behind.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2027+):</strong> The actuarial tables say you have another decade or two. The quality of those years depends on factors you can't fully control—genetics, luck, healthcare access. You'll watch your grandchildren navigate a world you won't fully understand. You'll hold opinions about it anyway. You'll tell stories about the old days, and they'll seem as distant to your grandkids as your grandparents' Depression stories seemed to you.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.3 million people born in 1957—one of the peak years of the baby boom. The entire Boomer generation is about 76 million Americans, a demographic bulge that has dominated American life for seven decades and counting.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you're more rebellious, more questioning of authority. The Silent Generation came of age during WWII and Korea. They conformed. You protested. They saved. You spent. They stayed married. You got divorced. They trusted institutions. You questioned everything.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more idealistic, for better and worse. Gen X grew up in your shadow, the forgotten middle children between Boomers and Millennials. They're more cynical, more pragmatic, less likely to believe the system can be changed. They never had your numbers, your cultural dominance, or your economic advantages.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the wealth gap is staggering. You controlled 21% of the nation's wealth when you were their age. They control 7%. You bought houses for three times your salary. They're paying ten times theirs. You had pensions. They have student loans. The generational transfer of opportunity stopped somewhere along the way.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're essentially visitors from another planet. They've never known a world without internet, without smartphones, without school shootings. Your formative experiences—Vietnam, moon landing, Watergate—are as distant to them as WWI was to you. You grew up with three TV channels. They grew up with infinite content, algorithmically served.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 69 years. Thanks to medical advances, you're likely to live into your eighties if you've made it this far. Your generation is healthier, wealthier, and more politically powerful at this age than any generation before. What you do with that power in your remaining years—the votes you cast, the policies you support, the resources you share—will shape the world long after you're gone.</p>"
