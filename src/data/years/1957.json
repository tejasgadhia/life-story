      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1957-1969</h2><p>The smell of Brylcreem and Aqua Velva. The crack of a wooden baseball bat on a summer evening. The weight of a View-Master in your hands, clicking through 3D slides of the Grand Canyon or Disneyland. Your childhood had a texture that kids today will never know—everything was tactile, local, present.</p><p>At five, you were watching Captain Kangaroo with Mr. Green Jeans, Romper Room where the teacher looked through her Magic Mirror, and The Mickey Mouse Club before Annette Funicello grew up. By seven, you'd graduated to Lassie, My Friend Flicka, and The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin—shows where animals were more reliable than adults. You had strong opinions about whether Timmy was actually that accident-prone or just dumb. (He was dumb. Obviously.)</p><p>Your toys were built to last. Lincoln Logs and Erector Sets for construction. Slinky going down the stairs, over and over. Mr. Potato Head with real potato pieces before the plastic body came along. The Hula Hoop craze hit when you were one—by the time you could walk, everyone was twisting their hips. Frisbees flew through every backyard. Play-Doh came in that distinctive yellow can with the smell that never quite left your memory.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant one thing: cartoons. You raced downstairs in footie pajamas, poured your own Frosted Flakes or Sugar Pops, and planted yourself in front of the TV. Huckleberry Hound. Quick Draw McGraw. The Flintstones when you were three—the first primetime animated sitcom. Commercials for toys you'd beg for until Christmas.</p><p>You ate TV dinners on metal trays with the turkey, mashed potatoes, and apple cobbler all in their little compartments. You drank Tang because the astronauts drank it (or so the commercials claimed). You begged for Jiffy Pop and watched the foil dome expand on the stovetop like magic. You put baseball cards in your bicycle spokes to make that motor sound. You genuinely believed the prize in the Cracker Jack box would be worth something.</p><p>At six, the world cracked. The principal's voice came over the intercom. Your mother was waiting at the school door. Adults cried in ways you'd never seen. You didn't understand collective mourning yet—the way a country's innocence could shatter in a single afternoon. Dallas taught you that lesson before you had words for it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The name sounds almost quaint now—a demographic term that became an identity, then a punchline, then a political faction. You're part of the post-WWII explosion of births that reshaped everything from school construction to rock and roll to social security projections. <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans, give or take. The largest generation in history until Millennials edged past you.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were six when Kennedy was shot. First grade. November 22, 1963.</span> You probably remember the teacher's face, the static of the intercom, the early dismissal. Adults were crying, and nobody would explain why. Your parents hugged you tighter that night. The funeral procession played on every channel. John-John's salute became one of the first images burned into your generational consciousness. This is your generation's defining rupture—the moment that split the American century in two.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964—a range so wide that early Boomers were fighting in Vietnam while late Boomers were still in diapers. You're from 1957, dead center of the boom. Old enough to have absorbed the idealism of the early sixties. Young enough to have caught the disillusionment of the late sixties. You got both, in sequence.</p><p>The second rupture came in 1968 when you were eleven. Martin Luther King Jr. shot in April. Bobby Kennedy shot in June. Cities burning. The Democratic convention in chaos. The year felt like America was coming apart at the seams, and you were old enough to watch it on the evening news, young enough to not fully understand, but precisely the right age to feel the ground shifting beneath you.</p><p>You're sandwiched between the Silent Generation (who remember the Depression and trusted institutions) and Gen X (who grew up in your cultural shadow and never expected stability). <span class=\"pull-quote\">You still believe change is possible. You marched, you protested, you voted. You've been doing it for fifty years.</span> <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Whether it worked depends on what metric you use.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, Elvis released 'Jailhouse Rock' and 'All Shook Up.' Buddy Holly was recording 'Peggy Sue.' Jerry Lee Lewis was scandalizing parents with 'Great Balls of Fire.' Rock and roll wasn't just music—it was generational warfare, and you arrived just as the battle was being won.</p><p>Your actual pop culture education started with American Bandstand. Dick Clark, clean-cut and eternally young, introducing the hits while Philadelphia teenagers danced in their school clothes. You learned the Twist, the Mashed Potato, the Watusi from watching that show. You had opinions about who the best dancers were.</p><p>At seven, you were watching The Flintstones, the first animated show in primetime—adults pretending to be for kids, or maybe the other way around. At eight, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Jetsons arrived in the same year, one looking backward, one forward. At nine, the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan, and every kid you knew was talking about it on Monday morning.</p><p>The British Invasion changed everything. You were seven when 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' hit the radio. By ten, you could name every Beatle and had strong opinions about whether John or Paul was the real genius. The Rolling Stones provided the alternative—dangerous where the Beatles were charming. You didn't have to choose, but you probably did.</p><p>Television of your formative years mixed comfort and chaos. Leave It to Beaver and The Andy Griffith Show showed an America that never quite existed. Bonanza and Gunsmoke dominated Saturday nights—thirty million people watching the same westerns. Then the evening news showed fire hoses in Birmingham, helicopters in Vietnam, protests on campus. Same screen, different channels, different Americas.</p><p>At twelve, 2001: A Space Odyssey bent your mind about what movies could do. At thirteen, Easy Rider showed you the counterculture from a motorcycle seat. At fourteen, Woodstock happened—maybe you went, probably you didn't, but you knew every band that played and wished you'd been there. The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin became saints who died too young.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The sound of a rotary phone is burned into your memory. That mechanical whir as the dial returned to position, the weight of the handset, the curly cord that never quite reached where you wanted to sit. You were born the same month Sputnik launched—October 1957—and the beeping of that Soviet satellite set the technological agenda for your entire childhood.</p><p>At two, you experienced the dawn of the transistor radio. Suddenly music was portable. You could take rock and roll to the beach, to your room, away from parental supervision. The transistor was tiny, the rebellion it enabled was not. By five, you had your own—probably a Christmas present, probably AM only, probably covered in fake leather.</p><p>Television was three channels and rabbit ears, adjusted constantly for better reception. You watched in black and white until around age ten, when color sets became affordable. The first time you saw Bonanza in color—the Ponderosa in full autumn foliage—felt like a revelation. Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color suddenly made sense.</p><p>Space Race technology defined your childhood expectations. Every Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo launch was appointment viewing. You knew astronaut names the way kids today know athletes. At twelve, you watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon, probably crowded around a TV with family, watching grainy footage and understanding, even then, that you were seeing history.</p><p>At fourteen, the first pocket calculators arrived—$400 for basic math. At nineteen, the first personal computers for hobbyists. At twenty-four, the IBM PC. At thirty-two, the World Wide Web. At forty-three, Google. At fifty, the iPhone. You went from party lines and operator-assisted calls to video chatting with grandchildren on the other side of the world. No generation spans that kind of technological distance.</p><p>You're fluent in technologies that no longer exist: typewriters, carbon paper, mimeograph machines, slide rules, phone booths, card catalogs, paper maps. You've learned every platform that came along—sometimes grudgingly, sometimes eagerly—because the alternative was obsolescence. You're not a digital native, but you've survived every digital disruption.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three weeks old when Sputnik launched—October 4, 1957. Your parents heard it on the radio, that beeping signal from space that meant the Soviets were ahead. The Space Race began with your birth year, and it would define your childhood's sense of possibility and anxiety in equal measure.</p><p>The civil rights movement happened on your television screen. You were three during the Greensboro sit-ins. Five during the Freedom Rides. Six when Bull Connor turned fire hoses on children in Birmingham. Seven when the Civil Rights Act passed. Nine when Watts burned. Eleven when King was murdered. You grew up watching America argue about what equality actually meant.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At six, Dallas. November 22, 1963. Where were you when you heard?</span> The rupture that defines your generation happened while you were in first grade. Here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape your entire understanding of American power.</p><p>At seven, the Beatles landed at JFK airport—February 1964. At eleven, King and Bobby Kennedy were killed two months apart, the country convulsing. At twelve, men walked on the moon—July 20, 1969—and for a moment, everything seemed possible. At thirteen, four students were shot at Kent State, and the war came home.</p><p>At eighteen, Vietnam ended—the fall of Saigon, helicopters lifting off rooftops, America's first lost war in your lifetime. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,000</span> American names on that wall. At twenty-three, Reagan was shot. At thirty-two, the Berlin Wall fell, and the Cold War you'd grown up under just... ended. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, planes hit the towers, and you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}}.</span> You were old enough to have perspective, to remember how different airports used to be, to understand that something fundamental had broken.</p><p>You've lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Watergate, Iran hostages, AIDS, Gulf War I, Gulf War II, Great Recession, COVID-19, and January 6th. You've watched the American century peak and begin its complicated decline. The arc of your life traces the arc of American power.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1979, give or take a few years. Stagflation, oil shocks, Carter's malaise speech. The economy was genuinely rough. But here's what rough looked like: Entry-level jobs existed. Companies hired people without experience and trained them. A college degree, if you had one, was a genuine differentiator—only 25% of your generation got one. If you didn't have a degree, union manufacturing jobs still paid enough to buy a house and raise a family.</p><p>Your career path looked like this: get hired, prove yourself, get promoted, stay for decades, get a pension, retire. The company wasn't your friend, but there was a social contract. They invested in you. You gave them loyalty. It wasn't perfect, but it was predictable. It was possible to plan a life around it.</p><p>You climbed the ladder when the ladder was still attached to something. Middle management existed as a destination, not just a waystation. Promotions came with real raises, not just title changes. Your peak earning years—your forties and fifties—coincided with the longest bull market in American history. The Reagan tax cuts. The Clinton boom. The math worked.</p><p>If you went into professions—medicine, law, engineering, accounting—you built equity when equity was building. You opened practices when malpractice insurance was affordable. You joined partnerships when partnerships were still partners, not employees of private equity firms. You accumulated credentials when credentials still protected territory.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and you watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> You're now retired or approaching retirement, which is a concept your children view as theoretical. You have Social Security at full benefits. You might have a pension—one of the last Americans who will. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The deal you got is the deal that disappeared. You didn't design the system—you just participated in it, followed the rules as they existed, built a life on a foundation that was later demolished for those who followed.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when having a crush meant riding your bike past their house? When getting their phone number was a victory, even though calling meant talking to their parents first, and the phone was in the kitchen where everyone could hear? When passing notes in class felt dangerously intimate?</p><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which arrived in stages. The Pill became available when you were three, widely adopted by the time you were sixteen. Premarital sex went from scandal to standard practice during your adolescence. Woodstock happened when you were twelve—'free love' was in the air even if you were too young to participate. By the time you dated seriously, the rules had changed from your parents' generation.</p><p>You probably got married younger than your children did. Average age at first marriage in 1980, when you were twenty-three: 22 for women, 25 for men. Today it's 28 and 30. You might have divorced, too—your generation normalized divorce, took the stigma away, made it a genuine option rather than a last resort. Whether that's liberation or loss depends on who you ask and when.</p><p>Your relationship with communication technology is genuinely remarkable. You grew up with rotary phones and party lines, where neighbors could listen in. Long-distance calls were expensive—you planned them, kept them short. You wrote letters by hand, waited days for responses. The pace of intimacy was slower, the anticipation longer.</p><p>You've adapted to every wave: touch-tone phones, answering machines, cordless phones, cell phones, smartphones, texting, video calls. You can write a proper letter and send an emoji. You've probably been frustrated teaching your parents to text and frustrated by your kids' texting habits. You're the bridge generation in communication, fluent in methods that span fifty years.</p><p>Your friendships required effort. No social media to maintain passive awareness. If you wanted to know how someone was doing, you called them, visited them, wrote them. Your address book was physical, handwritten, updated with each move and marriage. The friends you've kept for fifty years are friends because you actively chose to keep them, over and over.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by parents who survived the Depression. They saved obsessively, paid cash for everything, and treated debt like moral failure. They grew victory gardens, reused aluminum foil, kept rubber bands in kitchen drawers 'just in case.' You inherited their caution even as the economy encouraged spending.</p><p>In 1980, when you were twenty-three, a median home cost <span class=\"stat-box\">$47,200</span>—about 2.5 times the median household income. <span class=\"hero-callout\">You bought when buying was possible. You invested in stocks during the longest bull market in history. You accumulated assets while those assets were still on sale.</span></p><p>Credit cards arrived when you were in your twenties—Visa and Mastercard as we know them started in the late '60s and '70s. The idea of buying now and paying later was novel. Your parents would have been horrified. You adapted, using credit strategically while their voices echoed in your head about living within your means.</p><p>Your pension—if you have one—is increasingly rare. Defined benefit plans that guaranteed retirement income have been systematically dismantled since the 1980s, replaced by 401(k)s that shift all risk to workers. You might be among the last Americans to retire with genuine security, a monthly check that arrives regardless of what the stock market does.</p><p>You've watched the market boom and crash, boom and crash. Black Monday in 1987. The dot-com bubble. The 2008 collapse. Each time, you were told the fundamentals were sound. Each time, they weren't. You learned that the market is a casino with better PR, but you kept playing because mattresses don't compound.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">Your biggest financial anxiety now is longevity risk—outliving your savings.</span> You planned for retirement at 65, but you might live to 90. Healthcare costs compound. The math you did at forty doesn't work at seventy. Nobody told you to plan for three decades of not working.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is mistaking an exceptional economy for normal circumstances. The post-WWII boom that launched your life wasn't a baseline—it was a historical anomaly. American manufacturing dominance because Europe was rubble. Strong unions because the New Deal was fresh. High taxes on the wealthy because the war required shared sacrifice. Government investment in infrastructure because Eisenhower wanted highways.</p><p>That world doesn't exist anymore. But you sometimes give advice as if it does. 'Just walk in and ask for a job.' 'A firm handshake is what matters.' 'I started in the mailroom and worked my way up.' These strategies worked when companies trained people, when there were mailrooms, when showing up was half the battle. The disconnect frustrates younger people who've sent 200 applications into the digital void.</p><p>You adapted so successfully to change that you underestimate how hard adaptation is. You learned new technologies, new management styles, new workplace norms. Each time, you figured it out. But you also had stable employment while learning. Try learning new skills while working two gig jobs without health insurance. The runway you had doesn't exist.</p><p>There's a tendency to see systemic problems as individual failures. If younger generations can't afford houses, they must be spending frivolously. If they're anxious, they need to toughen up. If they're drowning in student debt, they should have chosen better majors. The possibility that the system changed, that the math no longer works, is hard to accept when the math worked so well for you.</p><p>Your generation struggled with racial reckoning. You grew up in segregated spaces even when segregation was technically illegal—redlined neighborhoods, tracked schools, 'good areas' that meant white areas. The progress you witnessed—civil rights laws, integration, a Black president—can make it seem like the work is done. It isn't. The systems became subtler, not smaller.</p><p>The climate crisis is another blind spot. You built the carbon-intensive economy and enjoyed its benefits. The worst consequences will arrive after you're gone. When younger people express climate grief, it can seem hyperbolic. When they demand systemic change, it can seem impractical. But they'll live with the floods and fires and famines. You mostly won't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1977-1987):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation, disco, and gas lines. The economy was rough—double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment. But jobs existed. You probably married younger than your children would, bought your first car, maybe your first house. The Iranian hostage crisis played on the nightly news for 444 days. Reagan arrived promising morning in America, and by your late twenties, the economy was booming. You started building.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1987-1997):</strong> This was your construction decade. Career advancement, family formation, asset accumulation. The Berlin Wall fell when you were thirty-two, and the Cold War you'd grown up under just... ended. The Soviet Union dissolved. History was supposedly over—liberal democracy had won. If you invested in stocks, you made money. If you bought real estate, you made more. Everything you'd been taught about hard work and reward seemed to be proving true.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1997-2007):</strong> Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. Your kids were teenagers, which was its own war zone. The internet arrived and changed everything, but you were established enough to adapt without starting over. The dot-com bubble inflated and burst—maybe you lost paper gains, probably nothing permanent. You were forty-four on 9/11, old enough to process it, young enough to live with the long aftermath of two new wars.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2007-2017):</strong> The Great Recession hit when you were fifty-one. If your house was your retirement plan, you watched it lose forty percent of its value. If you were planning early retirement, those plans got postponed. Recovery came, but it came slowly, unevenly. You started thinking seriously about how many working years remained, about whether Social Security would still be there, about what retirement actually meant.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2017-2027):</strong> You're here now, or just past it. Retirement is happening or already happened. Health is increasingly front of mind—you're watching friends deal with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, cognitive decline. COVID hit your age group harder than most. You've become expert at Zoom calls with grandchildren. You're thinking about legacy, about what you'll leave behind, about how to be useful in your remaining years.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2027+):</strong> The actuarial tables say you have one to two decades if you've made it this far. You'll watch grandchildren navigate a world increasingly foreign to your experience—climate changed, AI ascendant, democracy uncertain. You'll tell stories about rotary phones and Sputnik and JFK that will seem like science fiction. The challenge is staying engaged, staying relevant, staying connected across a generational chasm that widens every year.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>4.3 million people were born in the US the same year as you—1957 was peak baby boom, the demographic tsunami at full height. A cohort so large it bent every institution it passed through: schools in the '60s, colleges in the '70s, workplaces in the '80s, and now healthcare and Social Security systems adapting to your needs.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They came of age during the Depression and WWII. They learned to conform, to trust institutions, to defer gratification. You learned to question everything. They stayed married; you normalized divorce. They trusted authorities; you protested them. They built stable careers at single companies; you job-hopped and called it liberation. They think you were spoiled. You think they were repressed. You're both right.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They grew up in your shadow, the forgotten middle children. They were latchkey kids while you were protesting Vietnam. They entered the workforce during recessions while you were consolidating gains. They're more cynical because they had to be—the safety net you relied on was already fraying by the time they needed it. They don't expect pensions or Social Security. They've been preparing for collapse their whole lives.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap is staggering.</span> At their age, your generation controlled 21% of national wealth. They control 7%. You bought houses for three years' salary; they face eight to ten years' salary. You graduated into opportunity; they graduated into the Great Recession. They have the same degrees, the same work ethic, radically different outcomes. When they seem bitter, there's math behind it.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You're visitors from different planets. They've never known a world without internet, smartphones, school shootings, or climate anxiety. Your formative experiences—moon landing, Watergate, Vietnam—are as distant to them as WWI was to you. You grew up with three TV channels and mandatory family dinners. They grew up with infinite content, algorithmically served, in bedrooms with screens instead of windows.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Your generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Your life expectancy at birth was about 69 years.
