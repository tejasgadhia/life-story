      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year the Korean War started, Truman was president, and television was still a novelty that rich neighbors owned. The year 1950 was optimistic in ways that seem almost quaint now—America was the undisputed superpower, the economy was booming, and the suburbs were sprouting like crabgrass across the former farmland of Long Island.</p><p>Your childhood happened during the most prosperous peacetime economy in American history. Your parents—scarred by the Depression and World War II—were determined to give you what they never had: stability, a house with a yard, a stay-at-home mom making casseroles from recipes in women's magazines. The American Dream wasn't ironic yet. People believed in it.</p><p>You grew up with Cold War anxiety as background noise. Duck and cover drills taught you to hide under your desk when the nuclear bombs came, which would have done exactly nothing. Every kid knew about the Soviets. Every kid knew about The Bomb. You learned that the world could end at any moment, then went outside to play stickball until the streetlights came on.</p><p>Television arrived in your living room and changed everything. By the time you were eight, three-quarters of American homes had a set. You watched I Love Lucy, The Lone Ranger, and Howdy Doody. TV was appointment viewing—no reruns, no recording, no pausing. If you missed it, you missed it, and you'd hear about it at school the next day.</p><p>Your neighborhood was the world. Kids roamed freely in packs, unsupervised, until dinner. You built forts, played war, collected baseball cards that would be worth fortunes if your mother hadn't thrown them away. Childhood was about being outside, about physical space, about the kind of boredom that forces creativity because there's nothing else to do.</p><p>School was rigid. Teachers hit kids. Prayer was mandatory. Classrooms were segregated in half the country and de facto segregated in the other half. Girls took home economics; boys took shop. The curriculum assumed you'd grow up to be exactly like your parents, because that's what everyone did.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Cinderella dominated movie theaters, the year Nat King Cole sang 'Mona Lisa,' and the year Peanuts introduced the world to Charlie Brown and his existential despair. The culture of 1950 was wholesome on the surface, anxious underneath—much like everything about that era.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack was the last gasp of big band and the early stirrings of rock and roll. You were five when Elvis Presley exploded onto the scene, gyrating his hips in ways that made parents clutch their pearls and teenagers lose their minds. Rock and roll wasn't just music—it was the first thing your generation owned that your parents didn't understand.</p><p>TV shaped your consciousness in ways no previous generation experienced. The shows were simple by today's standards—variety shows, westerns, sitcoms where problems resolved in 30 minutes. Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver presented a vision of family life that nobody actually lived but everyone pretended to aspire to.</p><p>Movies in your childhood were spectacles. The Ten Commandments. Ben-Hur. Epics designed to get people off their couches and into theaters. You watched science fiction films that reflected Cold War paranoia—The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Aliens were always metaphors for Communists.</p><p>By the time you hit your teens, the culture had fractured. You were thirteen when JFK was assassinated, watching it on television like everyone else. The Beatles arrived six months later and blew the doors off everything. Your teenage years were the British Invasion, Motown, Bob Dylan going electric. Music became protest. Culture became political. The wholesome 1950s ended abruptly, and nothing was simple again.</p><p>You came of age during the most turbulent cultural decade in American history. Woodstock happened when you were nineteen. You might have been there. You might have wanted to be there. Either way, you watched your generation define itself against everything your parents believed, and the echoes of that rebellion shaped the next fifty years of American life.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born into a world that still ran on analog everything. The technology of 1950 was vacuum tubes and transistor radios, rotary phones and manual typewriters. Computers existed, but they filled entire rooms and were owned by governments and corporations. The idea of a personal computer was science fiction.</p><p>Television was the transformative technology of your childhood. Your family probably got their first TV when you were between five and eight years old. It changed how Americans received information, consumed entertainment, and understood the world. You were part of the first generation raised by the flickering blue glow.</p><p>The space race defined your adolescence. Sputnik launched when you were seven—a beeping Soviet satellite that terrified America into caring about science education. You watched the Mercury missions, the Gemini program, the Apollo launches. You were nineteen when Armstrong walked on the moon. Your generation put a man on the moon before you could legally drink.</p><p>Your early adulthood coincided with the first wave of computing. Mainframes ran corporations. Punch cards were state of the art. You probably didn't touch a computer until your thirties or forties, when PCs started showing up in offices. You learned technology as an adult, which is different from learning it as a child—you adapted rather than absorbed.</p><p>The internet arrived when you were in your forties. Email seemed miraculous. The World Wide Web was confusing and slow. You watched younger generations take to it naturally while you asked questions that made them roll their eyes. You're the generation that bridged the analog and digital worlds, competent in both but native to neither.</p><p>You've seen more technological change than any generation in history. Born before television was common, you've lived to see smartphones, streaming, and social media. You remember when long distance calls were expensive, when letters took days, when information required trips to the library. The pace of change you've witnessed is staggering, even if the young people in your life don't realize how recently all of this was impossible.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the Korean War, which started five months before your birth and would drag on until you were three. Your parents had just survived World War II, and here was another conflict, another draft, another generation of young men sent overseas. Korea was the first war America didn't clearly win, though nobody called it a loss either.</p><p>McCarthyism was in full swing during your early childhood. Senator Joseph McCarthy saw Communists everywhere—in Hollywood, in the State Department, in your neighbor's book collection. Blacklists ruined careers. Fear of being accused made people paranoid, cautious, conformist. The 1950s consensus wasn't just cultural preference; it was enforced.</p><p>You were thirteen when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. You remember exactly where you were. Everyone does. The assassination wasn't just the death of a president—it was the death of a certain kind of innocence. The 1960s broke open after that. Everything that came next—the Vietnam escalation, the riots, the other assassinations—traced back to that moment in Dealey Plaza.</p><p>Vietnam defined your late adolescence and early adulthood. You were draft age. You or your friends either went, got deferments, or fled to Canada. The war wasn't abstract—it was personal, immediate, possibly fatal. You watched body counts on the evening news. You watched protestors in the streets. You watched America tear itself apart over a war nobody could explain.</p><p>You were nineteen when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, nineteen when Robert Kennedy was shot two months later. You were nineteen during the chaos of the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. The year 1968 alone would be enough to traumatize a generation. It was only April by the time MLK died.</p><p>You were twenty-four during Watergate, watching a president resign in disgrace. You were thirty-nine when the Berlin Wall fell. Fifty-one during 9/11—old enough to have children who might be sent to the wars that followed. Fifty-eight during the 2008 financial crisis. Seventy when COVID-19 shut down the world. You've lived through more history than you ever asked for.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1972, after high school or college depending on your path. The economy was decent—not booming, but stable. Jobs existed. Pensions existed. The idea of staying at one company for forty years wasn't absurd; it was the expected trajectory. You could support a family on a single income if you worked hard and showed up on time.</p><p>Your generation benefited from timing in ways that subsequent generations did not. Housing was affordable. College was cheap—if you went. Union jobs paid enough to buy houses and raise families. The economic ladder had rungs, and climbing it was possible without generational wealth or extraordinary luck.</p><p>You witnessed the transition from manufacturing to service economy. The factories that employed your fathers started closing. Unions weakened. Job security became a quaint concept. You were middle management when the downsizing waves hit in the 1980s and 1990s—either you survived, or you were the one doing the cutting.</p><p>Women entered the workforce in unprecedented numbers during your career. When you started working, secretarial pools were still a thing. By the time you retired, women were CEOs and senators. The workplace you left looked nothing like the one you entered, for better and worse.</p><p>Technology transformed every industry while you were in it. You learned to use computers in your thirties or forties. You adapted to email, to the internet, to software that made entire job categories obsolete. You were too old to be a digital native but too young to avoid the transition entirely. You became competent through effort, not intuition.</p><p>If you followed the traditional path, you retired in your early sixties with a combination of pension, Social Security, and savings. You had job security your children never experienced. You had benefits packages that would seem luxurious today. You were the last generation to work in a world where companies felt obligations to employees rather than just shareholders.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by parents who survived the Great Depression. They saved obsessively, distrusted debt, and believed in tangible assets—houses, land, things you could touch. They taught you that security came from ownership and that luxury was dangerous. You inherited their caution even as you lived in unprecedented prosperity.</p><p>You bought your first house when houses were affordable. Median home prices in the early 1970s were about 2.5 times median income. A single-earner household could afford a mortgage. Down payments were within reach. The house you bought for $30,000 is now worth $500,000, and you don't entirely understand why except that everything costs more now.</p><p>Your generation accumulated wealth that subsequent generations cannot match. Not because you worked harder—that's a myth—but because the economics were different. Assets were cheaper relative to wages. Returns compounded over decades. Time in the market matters, and you had time that younger people don't have.</p><p>You watched the stock market transform from something for specialists to something everyone was supposed to participate in. 401(k)s replaced pensions, shifting risk from employers to employees. You learned investing terminology you never expected to need. You watched your retirement savings fluctuate with markets that seemed increasingly detached from real economic activity.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis hit when you were fifty-eight, close to retirement for many. You lost value on paper, watched the housing market crater, worried about whether you'd saved enough. Some of you delayed retirement. Some lost houses. The crisis was a reminder that security is always provisional, that the Depression wasn't ancient history after all.</p><p>Your generation controls more wealth than any in history—roughly $70 trillion in the United States alone. This makes your relationship with younger generations complicated. They see your houses, your pensions, your paid-off mortgages, and they see unfairness. They're not entirely wrong. The opportunities you had don't exist anymore, and no amount of bootstrapping creates them.</p>"

    "life_roadmap": {
      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You came of age during Vietnam and its aftermath. Your twenties were defined by choices about the draft, about protest, about what kind of adult you wanted to become. You probably married younger than subsequent generations—mid-twenties was typical. You bought your first house, started your career, had your first kids. The life script was clear and mostly achievable: job, spouse, house, children. You followed it because alternatives weren't obvious.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> Career advancement and family building. Reagan was president. The economy recovered from the malaise of the 1970s, then boomed. You were paying mortgages, raising children, climbing ladders. Work was demanding but rewarded loyalty. Your kids grew up during the prosperous 1980s, which shaped their expectations in ways that would cause problems later.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Peak earning years for most. Your kids were teenagers or leaving for college. The Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War anxiety you'd lived with your entire life evaporated practically overnight. You were middle-aged in a suddenly unipolar world, watching a peace dividend that turned out to be temporary. The 1990s dot-com boom made everyone feel rich, whether they were or not.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> You were fifty-one during 9/11. The attack felt like the end of something—the optimism of the 1990s, the sense that history was over and America had won. Your children, if you had them, were draft age for the wars that followed. You watched airport security become invasive. You watched the country go to war again, this time seemingly forever. The twenty-first century arrived with violence.</p><p><strong>Your 60s ({{SIXTIES_START}}-{{SIXTIES_END}}):</strong> Retirement planning and execution. Some of you retired early; some worked longer than expected. The 2008 financial crisis disrupted everything, shrinking retirement accounts and postponing exit dates. Your grandchildren were born. Your parents, if still living, needed care. You were sandwiched between generations, managing decline above and worry below.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond ({{SEVENTIES_START}}+):</strong> You are here now, or approaching. COVID-19 made your generation the highest-risk population. You watched the world shut down, watched younger people dismiss the danger, felt mortality in ways that were previously abstract. Retirement, if you achieved it, looks different than expected. Medical costs mount. Decisions about independence and care loom. You've outlived many of your cohort, which is a victory that doesn't feel like one.</p>"
