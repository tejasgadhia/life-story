      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You arrived the same year as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which would babysit you and your entire generation for the next decade. Ronald Reagan was starting his second term, Coca-Cola made the worst marketing decision in history with New Coke, and MTV still played music videos. Your birth announcement competed with Live Aid for attention.</p><p>Your earliest memories are probably filtered through the amber glow of late Reagan-era optimism—big hair, bigger shoulder pads, and the vague sense that America was winning something important. The Cold War was background noise, a distant threat that your parents worried about and you absorbed through Transformers cartoons where good always triumphed over evil. Simple times.</p><p>You were four when the Berlin Wall fell. You probably don't remember it, but you remember the adults around you acting like something important had happened. You were six when the Soviet Union collapsed entirely, which meant nothing to you at the time but meant everything to the adults who had spent their entire lives expecting nuclear annihilation. You inherited a world where the boogeyman had just been defeated, and nobody knew what came next.</p><p>The Gulf War happened when you were five or six—old enough for the images to stick, young enough for them to seem like a video game. CNN's 24-hour coverage invented modern war-as-entertainment. Green night-vision footage of tracer fire became the aesthetic of your childhood. You learned that wars could be watched live, and that watching somehow made you a participant.</p><p>Your childhood straddled the analog-digital divide. You had a Trapper Keeper and a Game Boy. You recorded songs off the radio onto cassette tapes, carefully timing the pause button to cut out the DJ. The library card catalog was still actual cards. Your family got a computer at some point—probably a Packard Bell or a Gateway—and it took up half a desk and ran Windows 3.1 like it was doing you a favor.</p><p>Saturday morning cartoons were sacred. You woke up early for them because there was no other way to see them. No DVR, no streaming, no YouTube. If you missed an episode of your show, you waited for the summer rerun and hoped. Delayed gratification wasn't a virtue—it was just how life worked.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996 according to Pew Research, which settled the debate after years of think pieces about where the line should fall. At 1985, you're solidly mid-range—old enough to remember the before-times, young enough to have grown up with the changes that came after.</p><p>Your generation is roughly 72 million people in the US, which made you the largest cohort until Gen Z started catching up. That size gave you cultural weight: marketers obsessed over you, politicians courted you, and everyone had an opinion about what was wrong with you.</p><p>The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. You were sixteen. A junior or senior in high school. Old enough to understand exactly what was happening, old enough to feel the world shift under your feet in real-time. You watched the towers fall during second period. Some of you watched people jump. The teachers didn't know what to say because there was nothing to say.</p><p>Everything before that day feels like a different country now. The pre-9/11 world was naive, optimistic, almost innocent. Airport security was a joke. Nobody knew what TSA stood for because it didn't exist yet. The word 'terrorism' meant something that happened in other places, to other people. After 9/11, you spent your entire adult life in a nation perpetually at war, perpetually afraid, perpetually suspicious of its own citizens.</p><p>Your generation graduated into the 2008 financial crisis, watched housing prices and student debt explode while wages flatlined, and somehow got blamed for killing everything from chain restaurants to the diamond industry. You didn't kill those things—you couldn't afford them. There's a difference.</p><p>Millennials are the sandwich generation: stuck between Gen X (who entered the workforce before the economy cratered) and Gen Z (who never expected the system to work for them in the first place). You're old enough to remember when the American Dream seemed achievable, young enough to have watched it become a punchline.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Back to the Future invented time-travel nostalgia as a commercial product. Michael J. Fox driving a DeLorean became the template for every rebooted franchise that would dominate your adult life. Hollywood learned that the past sells—and then spent the next forty years strip-mining your childhood for sequels, reboots, and cynical cash grabs.</p><p>The Breakfast Club came out in 1985, defining teen angst for a generation that wasn't yours yet. By the time you were old enough to watch it, the movie was already a cultural artifact—something your older cousins referenced, something that showed up in parodies. You inherited the vocabulary of teen rebellion without living through the original text.</p><p>Musically, 1985 was peak MTV. Madonna was in her 'Like a Virgin' era. Prince was fresh off Purple Rain. Bruce Springsteen was 'Born in the U.S.A.,' which people misunderstood as patriotic when it was actually deeply critical. We Are the World was everywhere, teaching you early that celebrity charity anthems don't actually fix anything.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack was early hip-hop going mainstream, hair metal fading into grunge, and Disney's animated renaissance making musicals acceptable for kids again. You watched The Little Mermaid at four, Beauty and the Beast at six, The Lion King at nine. Hakuna Matata became your generation's ironic motto—no worries, except for all the worries.</p><p>TV in your formative years meant Nickelodeon's golden age—Doug, Rugrats, Hey Arnold. It meant TGIF on ABC, where a lineup of family sitcoms taught you what normal families were supposed to look like (hint: nothing like yours). It meant The Fresh Prince teaching suburban kids about Philly and making Will Smith a star.</p><p>Your teen years belonged to TRL. Carson Daly counting down the videos while teenagers screamed on the streets of Times Square. NSYNC versus Backstreet Boys was a defining loyalty test. Britney's debut made everyone uncomfortable in ways they couldn't articulate. You developed musical taste in an era where music still cost money, which meant your choices mattered.</p><p>By college, you were downloading music illegally on Napster and LimeWire, never quite sure if that file was actually a song or a virus wearing a song's name. You probably killed the music industry a little. You don't feel that bad about it.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the first domain name was registered. symbolics.com, if you're curious. The internet existed only as a research project connecting a handful of universities. Tim Berners-Lee was still years away from inventing the World Wide Web. The digital revolution was coming, but in 1985, it was just a hum on the horizon.</p><p>The technology of your childhood was transitional. You had Nintendo—the original NES, with its gray cartridges and two-button controller. You blew into those cartridges to make them work, which wasn't actually how electronics functioned but everyone did it anyway. Video games were 8-bit and brutally hard. There was no saving your progress in the original Legend of Zelda. You either beat it in one sitting or started over.</p><p>You were ten when Windows 95 launched. You remember the hype—the Rolling Stones licensing 'Start Me Up,' stores at midnight, the sense that this was the future arriving. Your family probably got dial-up internet around then, the modem screaming its handshake while everyone agreed not to use the phone for the next hour.</p><p>You were twelve when AOL became ubiquitous. You probably had a screen name that embarrasses you now. You spent hours in chat rooms, lying about your age, learning that the internet was a place where nobody knew who you really were—and that could be liberating or terrifying depending on who you met.</p><p>You were thirteen when Google launched, though you probably didn't use it right away. Ask Jeeves and Yahoo were still the defaults. You were fourteen when Napster changed everything—suddenly music was free, and the industry scrambled to stop a genie that was already out of the bottle.</p><p>The iPod arrived when you were sixteen. The iPhone when you were twenty-two, right as you graduated college. Facebook opened to everyone when you were twenty-one. You didn't grow up with smartphones—you watched them colonize adulthood in real-time. You're fluent in the technology but not native to it. You remember what it was like before, which makes you suspicious in ways Gen Z isn't.</p><p>This gives you a weird superpower: you can troubleshoot your parents' Wi-Fi and explain TikTok to your aunts, but you also remember using card catalogs and printing out MapQuest directions. You're bilingual in a way that's increasingly rare.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three months old when the wreck of the Titanic was discovered on the ocean floor—a piece of lost history suddenly becoming real again. You were born into a year of strange portents: earthquakes in Mexico City killed thousands, hijackers took over a cruise ship, and the hole in the ozone layer was first identified. The world you entered was already showing cracks.</p><p>You were four when the Berlin Wall fell. You probably don't remember it directly, but you absorbed the energy—the celebration, the sense that history was moving in the right direction. By six, the Soviet Union had collapsed entirely. The Cold War that defined your parents' entire lives ended before you finished first grade. You inherited a world that seemed, briefly, to be getting better.</p><p>The Gulf War happened when you were five, just old enough for the images to register. Green night-vision footage of tracer rounds. CNN reporters in gas masks. The war lasted six weeks and felt like a video game—clean, precise, victorious. It taught you that American military power was unstoppable and wars could be won quickly. Both lessons would prove catastrophically wrong later.</p><p>You were ten when the Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people. Domestic terrorism wasn't supposed to happen here. The image of that destroyed building, the firefighter carrying the baby—those stuck with you even if you were too young to fully process them. You learned that the threats weren't just external.</p><p>Princess Diana died when you were twelve. The global mourning felt strange, excessive, performative—but it was also genuine. You watched billions of people grieve together through television screens. It was practice for the collective trauma that came later.</p><p>Columbine happened when you were fourteen. You were a freshman. School shootings had happened before, but this one became the template. The footage, the coverage, the endless why. Your school probably had its first lockdown drill not long after. The active shooter wasn't a nightmare scenario anymore—it was curriculum.</p><p>9/11 happened when you were sixteen. You were a junior. You watched the second plane hit during second period. Some of you watched people jump rather than burn. The towers collapsed before lunch. School let out early, or didn't—either way, nothing felt normal. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq followed, and they just kept going. Your entire post-adolescent life has happened against the backdrop of forever war.</p><p>You were twenty-three when the 2008 financial crisis hit. You either graduated directly into the wreckage or watched the job market you were about to enter collapse. Banks failed. Retirement accounts evaporated. The economy your parents promised wasn't available at any price.</p><p>COVID hit when you were thirty-five. By then, you'd lived through enough disasters that a global pandemic almost felt like more of the same. One more crisis, one more adaptation, one more reason to doubt that stability would ever arrive.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated college around 2007—walking directly into the teeth of the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. Perfect timing. The job market cratered. Entry-level positions evaporated or demanded five years of experience you couldn't possibly have. The economy shed 8.7 million jobs between 2008 and 2010. You were competing with laid-off professionals for barista positions.</p><p>Your early career was defined by scarcity. Unpaid internships became the only way to get a foot in doors that kept slamming shut. You took jobs that had nothing to do with your degree because any job was better than no job. You learned to frame 'couldn't find anything in my field' as 'exploring diverse opportunities.' Resume optimization became a survival skill.</p><p>Your generation normalized job-hopping not out of restlessness but necessity. Companies stopped being loyal, so you stopped being loyal back. Pensions vanished years ago. Raises became 'you're lucky to have a job' lectures. The implicit contract between employer and employee—you work hard, we take care of you—had been shredded before you even entered the workforce.</p><p>You pioneered the 'side hustle' as a concept, though the reality was less entrepreneurial and more desperate. One job didn't pay enough, so you drove Uber. You sold things on Etsy. You did freelance work at 3 AM. The gig economy wasn't liberation—it was multiple forms of exploitation wearing a single outfit.</p><p>You've worked in offices with ping pong tables and beer fridges and 'unlimited vacation' policies that punished anyone who actually took time off. You've heard about company culture from executives who wouldn't last a week doing your job. You've been told to bring your 'whole self' to work by HR departments that would fire that whole self the moment quarterly earnings dipped.</p><p>Remote work became normal because of COVID, which was the one good thing to come out of that nightmare. You proved you could do your job from anywhere. In return, companies expected you to do your job from everywhere, all the time, always reachable, never truly off. The boundary between work and life dissolved entirely.</p><p>By your late thirties, you're probably making more money than you did at twenty-five. It still doesn't feel like enough. The goalposts keep moving. The stability your parents had by your age remains elusive. You're not failing—the system is. That's cold comfort when the bills are due.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Your romantic history spans the entire evolution of modern dating. You probably had your first girlfriend or boyfriend via passed notes and landline phone calls. By college, you were texting. By your late twenties, you were swiping. You've experienced every iteration of courtship technology, which makes you either an expert or exhausted. Probably both.</p><p>Tinder launched when you were twenty-seven, already old enough to have met partners the traditional way but young enough to get sucked into the algorithmic dating machine. You watched romance become gamified, relationships become transactions, connection become something you optimized for rather than fell into.</p><p>You're the bridge generation for dating—old enough to have met partners at parties, through friends, in person; young enough to have swiped right on strangers and called it normal. Your parents think online dating is desperate. Your younger cousins can't imagine meeting any other way. You're stuck in the middle, aware that both methods have problems and neither guarantees anything.</p><p>Communication in your relationships evolved in real-time. You've sent handwritten letters, AIM instant messages, texts, DMs, voice memos, and FaceTime calls. You've had entire relationships happen primarily through screens. You've learned that the medium shapes the message—that things hit different over text than in person, that emoji can defuse or escalate, that read receipts are a form of psychological warfare.</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage longer than any before. The median age at first marriage climbed from 23 (women) and 26 (men) when you were born to 28 and 30 by your thirties. It's not that you don't want partnerships—it's that weddings are expensive, houses are expensive, kids are expensive, and your student loans demand their cut of everything.</p><p>You've probably lived with a partner before marrying them, which scandalized your grandparents and bored your friends. Cohabitation became the norm because commitment without a lease didn't make economic sense. You split rent and utilities before you split a last name.</p><p>Friendships for your generation are maintained across distance in ways previous generations couldn't imagine. You have group chats with people you see once a year. You know intimate details about friends who live three time zones away. Physical proximity matters less when you can text at any hour, which is liberating but also means you never have to actually show up.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by watching things collapse repeatedly. You were fifteen when the dot-com bubble burst. Twenty-three when the 2008 crisis evaporated $17 trillion in household wealth. Thirty-five when COVID crashed the economy again. You've been conditioned to expect disaster, which makes it hard to plan for anything else.</p><p>You graduated with student debt and entered a job market that was on fire—not the good kind. The average debt for the Class of 2007 was around $20,000; it's been climbing ever since. That number followed you for years, decades, maybe your entire adult life depending on interest rates and forbearance programs. It was the anchor you dragged into every financial decision.</p><p>Home ownership—the cornerstone of the American Dream your parents inherited—has been increasingly out of reach. In 1985, when you were born, the median home cost about 3 times the median income. By the time you were trying to buy, it was 5 to 7 times. You're not bad at money. The math just doesn't work.</p><p>Your generation rents longer, saves less, and accumulates assets more slowly than any generation before. When Boomers were your age, they controlled about 21% of the nation's wealth. Millennials control around 7%. The gap isn't laziness or avocado toast—it's math. Wages stagnated while costs exploded. You're running on a treadmill that keeps speeding up.</p><p>You've developed coping mechanisms. You track spending obsessively in apps. You participate in 'no spend' challenges. You side hustle to supplement income that should be sufficient but isn't. You know more about compound interest and index funds than your parents did at your age, and you're still falling behind.</p><p>The retirement fantasy your parents described—sixty-five and done, golf and grandchildren—feels like science fiction. Social Security might still exist when you're seventy. It might not. Either way, you're not counting on it. You're investing in your 401(k) because the alternative is working until you die, and you're aware that the market could collapse at any moment and take your savings with it. This is called being financially responsible. It feels more like being financially haunted.</p><p>You've redefined what success looks like because the old definitions were foreclosed. Success isn't the house—it's not being evicted. Success isn't retirement—it's having an emergency fund. Success isn't wealth accumulation—it's debt management. You've lowered the bar because you couldn't clear the old one, and you've made peace with that. Mostly.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest strength is adaptability. You've pivoted careers, learned new technologies, adjusted expectations, and survived crisis after crisis. The flip side of that adaptability is that you've normalized dysfunction. You've gotten so good at coping with broken systems that you sometimes forget to demand better ones.</p><p>You accept workplace practices that previous generations would have rejected outright. Unpaid overtime as 'dedication.' Always being available as 'being a team player.' Health insurance tied to employment as 'just how it works.' You've internalized precarity to the point where stability feels suspicious, like something must be wrong if nothing is going wrong.</p><p>Your relationship with self-improvement is borderline pathological. You track everything—sleep, steps, screen time, spending, calories. You approach your own existence like a productivity problem to be optimized. The quantified self is useful, but it can also become a way of avoiding the messier work of actually living. Not everything that counts can be counted.</p><p>You're so steeped in irony that earnestness feels dangerous. You can't just like something—you have to like it 'ironically' or acknowledge its problematic elements while enjoying it anyway. This protective layer of detachment shields you from criticism but also makes it harder to care deeply about anything, including yourself.</p><p>Your generation excels at identifying problems but struggles with collective action. You're great at calling things out, less great at organizing to fix them. You can mobilize online for a cause, but voting rates and union membership tell a different story. Digital activism feels like action. Often it's just performance.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that serve employers and harm you. You've been trained to be team players, to not rock the boat, to bring solutions rather than problems. This makes you easy to exploit. You'll negotiate salary via email because asking in person feels confrontational. You'll accept lowball offers because any offer is a blessing. You've confused being agreeable with being professional.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is intimate but uncritical. You know social media is bad for you and you use it anyway. You know the attention economy is designed to exploit you and you participate anyway. You're aware of the problem and still part of it. This isn't hypocrisy—it's the trap. Knowing you're in a trap doesn't get you out.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You graduated into economic rubble. The Class of 2007-2009 entered the worst job market since the Depression. You took what you could get—service jobs, temp work, positions you were wildly overqualified for. You moved back home or crammed into apartments with multiple roommates. You delayed everything: marriage, kids, homeownership, adulthood itself. This was supposed to be your decade of exploration and self-discovery. Instead, it was your decade of survival. You did what you had to do, and you're still recovering from the scars.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> Your earning potential improved, but the goalposts moved with it. You're making more than you did at twenty-five, but costs climbed faster than wages. You're probably more established—better jobs, actual careers, maybe some savings. You're also watching younger people enter the workforce with skills you have to scramble to learn. This is the decade of building: building stability, building relationships, building whatever version of adult life you can afford. Some of your friends have kids now. Some have houses. Some have neither and are wondering if they ever will.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Statistically, your peak earning decade. You'll have more authority, more clarity, more acceptance of both your capabilities and limitations. If you have kids, they'll be school-aged or older—expensive in different ways. Your parents will be aging, which introduces new responsibilities you didn't ask for but can't avoid. You're sandwiched between generations, managing everyone's needs while trying not to lose yourself in the caretaking. This is the decade where you either consolidate everything you've built or realize you need to blow it up and start fresh. Both are valid choices.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> By now, you'll have weathered at least four economic crises, multiple 'once-in-a-generation' disasters, and an endless series of events that were supposed to be impossible until they happened. You'll be approaching traditional retirement age but unable to retire—because savings evaporated, because Social Security shrank, because the retirement your parents had isn't available anymore. You'll mentor younger workers who don't understand your scars, and you'll catch yourself sounding like every older generation before you. That's fine. They earned it too.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_START}}+):</strong> Retirement, if it comes, won't look like your parents' version. It'll involve part-time work, gig economy supplementation, or reliance on kids who are struggling themselves. The world will be unrecognizable—climate change reshaping geography, technology reshaping society, demographic shifts reshaping politics. You'll tell younger people what life was like before the internet, before smartphones, before everything accelerated beyond recognition. They'll nod politely and not believe you. That's fair. You wouldn't have believed it either.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.76 million people born in 1985. The entire Millennial generation is about 72 million people in the US—the largest generation until Gen Z overtakes it. Your demographic weight made you culturally significant: endlessly studied, constantly marketed to, perpetually blamed for industries you couldn't afford to support.</p><p>Compared to Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), the wealth disparity is staggering. Boomers controlled about 21% of the nation's wealth when they were your age. Millennials control around 7%. Boomers bought houses on single incomes; you need dual incomes and still can't afford down payments. Boomers had pensions; you have 401(k)s that lose value every time the market sneezes. Boomers retired at sixty-five; you're hoping to retire before death.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more educated, more diverse, and significantly poorer. Gen X entered the workforce before the economy fully collapsed—they got in under the wire. They had access to affordable college and job markets that hadn't yet been hollowed out. They're not unsympathetic to your situation, but they also can't fully understand it. The gap is smaller than with Boomers, but it's there.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're similar but marked differently. You remember a time before everything was terrible—that's the key distinction. Gen Z never expected the system to work. They were born into perpetual crisis and adapted accordingly. You're more optimistic, which is either a strength or a delusion depending on the day. They're more pragmatic, which is either wisdom or surrender. You adapted to smartphones; they were born holding them.</p><p>Your life expectancy is around 78-80 years, slightly lower than previous generations due to rising rates of what researchers call 'deaths of despair'—suicide, drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths. Your generation has worse mental health outcomes than any before: higher rates of anxiety, depression, and medication. The world you inherited is harder, lonelier, and more expensive than the one that was promised.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more educated, and more aware of systemic injustice than any generation before. You've normalized therapy, destigmatized mental health, pushed for equity and inclusion in ways your parents' generation didn't. You've made the world more humane even as it's become less affordable. You didn't get the life you were promised, but you've made the life you have more bearable—for yourself and for everyone coming after.</p>"
