      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-2020</h2><p>You were born the year the global financial system collapsed and Barack Obama became the first Black president. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Your parents were probably watching their 401(k) evaporate while you were learning to breathe. Welcome to Earth—everything is on fire.</p><p>Your earliest memories exist in a world that was already digital. You probably don't remember a time before touchscreens. The iPad launched when you were two. By the time you were five, you could operate a tablet better than most adults. Your parents handed you a glowing rectangle to keep you quiet in restaurants, and it worked, and now everyone has opinions about what that did to your brain.</p><p>You were four when Instagram launched. Six when Snapchat appeared. You've never known a world where people didn't broadcast their lives to strangers. Social media isn't something you adopted—it's the water you swim in. You don't remember the alternative.</p><p>Your childhood was post-recession anxiety dressed up as economic recovery. Things were technically getting better, but nobody felt it. Your parents probably talked about money differently than their parents did—more carefully, more fearfully. You absorbed that anxiety without understanding where it came from.</p><p>You were twelve when COVID-19 shut everything down. Sixth or seventh grade, depending on when your birthday falls. You finished middle school on Zoom. You missed school dances, graduation ceremonies, and the normal awkward social development that happens when teenagers are forced to interact in person. A chunk of your adolescence happened in your bedroom, staring at a screen, isolated in ways no generation before you experienced.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Generation Z</h2><p>You're Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012. The name is uninspired—we literally just ran out of alphabet after Gen Y (Millennials). Some researchers call you 'Zoomers,' which is either a reference to Zoom fatigue or a play on 'boomers.' Neither explanation is satisfying.</p><p>Your generation is roughly 68 million people in the US, which makes you just slightly smaller than Millennials but significantly more diverse. You're the most racially and ethnically diverse generation in American history. You're also the least religious, most educated, and most likely to identify as LGBTQ+.</p><p>The defining moment for Gen Z is harder to pin down than 9/11 was for Millennials. It might be COVID. It might be the George Floyd protests. It might be climate change awareness, or school shootings, or the 2016 election. Your generation has been shaped by overlapping crises rather than a single defining event.</p><p>You've never known a pre-smartphone world. You've never known an economy that wasn't recovering from something. You've never known political discourse that wasn't toxic. You were born into chaos and treated it as normal because you had no baseline for comparison.</p><p>Older generations call you fragile, anxious, phone-addicted. You call yourselves realistic. You've been handed a planet on fire, an economy that doesn't work, and institutions that have failed repeatedly. Your pessimism isn't a character flaw—it's pattern recognition.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year The Dark Knight redefined superhero movies and Wall-E made everyone cry about a trash-collecting robot. Iron Man launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which would dominate your entire childhood and adolescence. You grew up in the golden age of franchise filmmaking—everything was a sequel, prequel, or extended universe.</p><p>Musically, 2008 gave us Lady Gaga's 'Just Dance,' Katy Perry kissing girls and liking it, and Beyoncé asking us to put a ring on it. Auto-Tune was everywhere. Kanye released 808s & Heartbreak and invented a whole new aesthetic of emotionally devastated synthpop. T-Pain made everyone sound like they were singing through a blender.</p><p>Your childhood soundtrack was probably a blur of whatever your parents played and whatever YouTube's algorithm fed you. You might have discovered music through Pandora, then Spotify, then TikTok. You've never bought a physical album. The concept of going to a store to purchase music is as foreign to you as the phonograph.</p><p>You grew up with YouTube as a primary entertainment source. Your childhood heroes weren't just movie stars—they were vloggers, gamers, unboxing channels. You probably watched more content made by random people in their bedrooms than anything produced by major studios.</p><p>The Marvel movies were your Harry Potter. The Harry Potter movies were already finishing when you were born. You inherited fandoms rather than building them. By the time you were old enough to care, every franchise had decades of lore and argument about which installment was best.</p><p>TikTok became your defining platform in your early teens. Short-form video, algorithmic curation, trends that lasted 72 hours. Your attention span isn't broken—it's adapted to an environment designed to capture attention in 15-second bursts.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the iPhone App Store launched, which means the entire mobile app economy is exactly your age. The first Android phone came out in October. Cloud computing was becoming a thing. You've never known a world where software came in a box you bought at a store.</p><p>You were two when the iPad launched. Three when Siri arrived. Four when Instagram was acquired by Facebook. Five when Snapchat added Stories. Six when Amazon Echo brought Alexa into homes. Every year of your childhood brought new technology that previous generations had to learn but you absorbed like oxygen.</p><p>You're a true digital native, but that term has become meaningless through overuse. Here's what it actually means: you don't remember learning to use technology because it was always there. You don't have a 'before' to compare to. Older people talk about the internet like it changed everything. To you, it just is everything.</p><p>Your generation learned to read partly on screens. You probably did online learning before COVID made it mandatory. You've submitted homework through portals, taken tests on tablets, and had teachers email your parents before you could intercept the report card.</p><p>You've grown up under surveillance in ways previous generations didn't. Your digital footprint started before you could consent to it. Your parents posted photos of you as a baby. Your schools tracked your browsing. Your phone tracks your location. You've never had the option of being offline.</p><p>AI started getting good during your adolescence. By the time you're entering the workforce, you'll be competing with (and working alongside) tools that didn't exist when you were born. Your relationship with technology isn't nostalgia-tinged like older generations—it's purely practical. It's just tools, constantly changing.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three months old when Barack Obama was elected president. The first Black president. Historic moment. You don't remember it because you were busy learning object permanence. By the time you were aware of presidents, Obama was just the guy who'd always been there, then suddenly wasn't.</p><p>You were eight when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. You probably don't remember it being illegal. Your generation treats LGBTQ+ rights as obvious, which is progress, even if you don't appreciate how recently that progress happened.</p><p>You were eight when Donald Trump descended an escalator and announced his presidential campaign. You were nine when he won. Your political awareness developed during the most divisive era in modern American politics. You've never known a time when everyone could agree on basic facts.</p><p>You were twelve when COVID-19 hit. Your entire adolescence got interrupted. You did school on Zoom. You missed proms, graduations, normal teenage experiences. You watched adults argue about masks while people died. You learned that institutions could fail spectacularly and life would just continue anyway.</p><p>You were thirteen during the George Floyd protests, the largest protest movement in American history. You watched cities burn on your phone. You might have attended protests yourself. You've grown up with police violence as a constant news story, not a revelation.</p><p>You were thirteen when the Capitol was stormed. You watched it live, probably on multiple screens simultaneously. You've seen American democracy tested in ways your parents never imagined when they were your age.</p><p>Climate change has been a constant background anxiety your entire life. You've never known a time when scientists weren't warning about it. You've grown up watching disasters get worse—fires, floods, hurricanes—and watching adults fail to address it. Your generation's relationship with the future is fundamentally different because you're not sure there's a stable planet waiting for you there.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You're just entering the workforce, or you're about to. The economy you're inheriting is post-pandemic, inflation-scarred, and AI-disrupted. Welcome to your professional life. The rules are being rewritten while you're learning them.</p><p>Your generation is the most educated in history, which means a bachelor's degree is now what a high school diploma used to be: the minimum. Graduate degrees are increasingly necessary for jobs that used to require only college. Credential inflation is real, and you're paying for it—literally, in student loans.</p><p>You'll enter the workforce around {{TWENTIES_START}}. By then, AI will have transformed entire industries. Jobs that exist today won't exist when you're thirty. Jobs you'll have at forty don't exist yet. Your career path won't be a ladder—it'll be a scramble through constantly shifting terrain.</p><p>Remote work is normal to you. Hybrid work is normal to you. The idea of commuting to an office five days a week seems inefficient and unnecessary. You'll have to navigate workplaces where older employees romanticize 'office culture' while you wonder why you can't just do this from your apartment.</p><p>You've watched Millennials burn out and Gen X get laid off. You're entering the workforce with eyes wide open. You don't expect companies to be loyal. You don't expect pensions or long-term stability. You're planning for a career of constant adaptation because that's all you've ever seen.</p><p>The gig economy will probably be a significant part of your working life, whether you want it to be or not. Side hustles aren't optional for your generation—they're survival strategy. The single-employer, forty-year career is a historical artifact. You're building a portfolio career whether you planned to or not.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You've never known dating without apps. By the time you're old enough to date seriously, swiping will have been normalized for over a decade. Meeting someone 'in real life' will feel quaint, romantic, almost rebellious. Your grandparents met at church. Your parents met at work or school. You'll meet someone whose profile you liked at 2 AM.</p><p>Your generation communicates through layers of irony that older people find exhausting. Sincerity is cringe. Everything is 'no cap' or 'lowkey' or wrapped in enough qualifiers that you can pretend you weren't really saying what you said. This makes authentic emotional connection both desperately desired and terrifyingly vulnerable.</p><p>You've maintained friendships through group chats and Discord servers. Your closest friends might be people you've never met in person. The distinction between online and offline relationships is blurry for you in ways older generations don't understand.</p><p>You're getting married later than any previous generation, if you get married at all. Not because you don't want partnership, but because the economics don't make sense. Weddings are expensive. Housing is expensive. The traditional milestones are increasingly out of reach, so you're inventing new ones.</p><p>You've grown up watching relationships play out on social media. You've seen couples post their perfect lives and then announce divorces. You're skeptical of performance, even as you perform yourself. You know the difference between the curated version and the real version, and you're exhausted by the gap.</p><p>Your generation talks about mental health openly in ways that would have been unthinkable for your grandparents. You've normalized therapy, medication, boundaries. This is progress. It's also created new anxieties—the pressure to be constantly healing, constantly optimizing, constantly working on yourself.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were born into a recession. Your earliest years were defined by recovery that never felt complete. You've never known an economy that wasn't anxious, precarious, or actively collapsing. Your financial psychology is shaped by scarcity you experienced before you could name it.</p><p>Your generation has watched housing prices become detached from reality. By the time you can afford a down payment, homes will cost even more. The math doesn't work. You know this. You're either making peace with renting forever or hoping for an inheritance that might not come.</p><p>Student loan debt will define your early adult financial life, unless you chose trade school, community college, or managed to get scholarships. The cost of education has tripled since your parents were in school. The return on investment is increasingly questionable.</p><p>You've grown up with financial content creators explaining the stock market on TikTok, crypto evangelists promising the future, and meme stocks demonstrating that markets are partially a collective hallucination. Your relationship with investing is simultaneously more accessible and more confusing than any previous generation.</p><p>Climate change affects your financial thinking in ways it didn't affect previous generations. Why save for a house in a place that might flood? Why plan for retirement on a planet that might be unlivable? Your long-term planning has an asterisk that previous generations didn't have to consider.</p><p>You're pragmatic about money in ways Millennials weren't at your age. You've seen what happens when the system fails. You're not optimistic about the economy fixing itself. You're saving because you don't trust anything else to catch you. You're hustling because the alternative is worse.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's relationship with technology is so seamless that you might not recognize how it shapes you. You've never known life without algorithms. You don't realize how much your worldview has been curated by systems optimized to capture your attention. The filter bubble isn't something you fell into—it's all you've ever known.</p><p>You're so accustomed to crisis that you might mistake dysfunction for normal. Climate change, political instability, economic precarity—these aren't aberrations to you. They're the baseline. This makes you resilient, but it might also make you accept conditions that previous generations would have found intolerable.</p><p>Your irony-poisoning can make earnest engagement difficult. When everything is half-joking, nothing can be fully committed to. This protects you from disappointment but also from the kind of sincere effort that actually changes things. You can't ironically solve problems.</p><p>Your generation is extremely online, which means your perception of reality is shaped by whatever's trending. Issues that dominate your timeline might be genuinely important or might be manufactured outrage. The distinction is hard to make when you're inside the machine.</p><p>You've been told you're special and fragile simultaneously. You've had your emotions validated and your coping mechanisms pathologized. You're both coddled and neglected, over-praised and under-supported. This contradiction produces confusion about what you actually need and deserve.</p><p>Your generation communicates brilliantly through memes and struggles to communicate directly. You can summarize complex emotions in image form but stumble when asked to articulate needs in words. This makes relationships, professional communication, and self-advocacy harder than they need to be.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your Late Teens (Now - {{TWENTIES_START}}):</strong> You're finishing high school or in your first years of college. The pandemic disrupted your adolescence in ways we're still measuring. You're trying to figure out what you want to do with your life while the economy reshapes itself and AI changes what jobs even mean. This is supposed to be about exploration and identity formation. It's also about survival, debt decisions, and trying to find stable ground that keeps shifting.</p><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> This will be your decade of becoming. You'll finish your education, start your career, probably change jobs several times. You'll figure out who you are apart from your family, your school, your hometown. You'll probably rent in expensive cities because that's where the jobs are. You'll watch older generations struggle and try to learn from their mistakes. Dating will be app-based, career will be portfolio-based, identity will be constantly negotiated.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> By now you'll be established in something—career, relationship, city, identity. Or you'll be pivoting, because your generation pivots. Housing will still be expensive, but you might have found a way in. Kids might be in the picture, or deliberately not. You'll be old enough to mentor younger people and young enough to be baffled by whatever generation comes after Z. This is the decade where childhood finally feels distant and adulthood feels real.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Peak earning years, if earnings are still a thing. You'll have authority at work, clarity about what matters, less patience for nonsense. Your parents will be aging. Climate change will have made certain places unlivable. The world will look different in ways you can't predict from here. You'll be the establishment, which is a strange feeling for a generation raised on disruption.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> You'll be pre-retirement age in a world where retirement might not exist as a concept. You'll have lived through multiple pandemics, economic collapses, and political upheavals. You'll be mentoring people who don't remember COVID. You'll explain what TikTok was to people who find it quaint. The future is unwritable from here, but you'll navigate it the way you've navigated everything—adapting, adjusting, figuring it out.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_START}}+):</strong> Whatever retirement looks like in 2068, it won't look like what your grandparents had. Social Security is a question mark. Climate change will have reshaped geography. The technology you grew up with will be museum pieces. You'll tell young people about the before times, and they won't believe you either.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.2 million people born in 2008. The entire Gen Z generation is about 68 million people in the US, slightly smaller than Millennials but more diverse, more educated, and more digitally native.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're more pessimistic and more pragmatic. Millennials believed the system could be fixed. You assume it's broken and plan accordingly. They adapted to smartphones. You were shaped by them. They remember the before times. You only know the after.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're practically from another planet. They grew up analog. You've never been analog. They were latchkey kids with independence. You were tracked and monitored. They're cynical from experience. You're cynical from observation.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the gap is so vast it's hard to bridge. They inherited an economy that worked. You inherited the wreckage. They bought houses for a year's salary. You rent. They retired with pensions. You're not sure retirement exists. The generational wealth transfer everyone talks about is the only thing standing between you and permanent precarity.</p><p>Compared to Gen Alpha (born 2012-2025), you're the last generation with any memory of life before everything was AI-mediated. You had an adolescence. They're having something else entirely—childhood shaped by technology that's genuinely different from anything before. You'll be the ones explaining what humans used to do before AI did it for them.</p><p>Your life expectancy is slightly lower than previous generations, continuing a trend that started with Millennials. Deaths of despair—suicide, overdose, alcohol—are part of it. So is healthcare access. So is stress. Your generation has higher rates of anxiety and depression than any before, though it's unclear how much is increased prevalence and how much is decreased stigma about reporting.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more environmentally conscious, and more aware of systemic injustice than any previous generation. You've grown up in a world that's more diverse and more connected. You've had access to information that previous generations couldn't imagine. Whether that makes you better equipped or just better informed about how bad things are remains to be seen.</p>"
