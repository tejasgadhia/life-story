      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You arrived the year Saigon fell, Saturday Night Live premiered, and Microsoft was founded in a garage in Albuquerque. Gerald Ford was president because the previous two guys had either resigned in disgrace or gotten shot. The nation was hungover from Watergate, still processing Vietnam, and about to discover disco. Congratulations.</p><p>Your early years were pure 1970s: wood-paneled station wagons, shag carpet, and television with three channels plus PBS. Gas lines were a thing. So were pet rocks. Adults smoked everywhere—cars, restaurants, airplanes, hospitals. The air quality of your childhood would horrify modern parents, but somehow you survived.</p><p>Ronald Reagan won the presidency when you were five, and his administration would define your formative years. Morning in America, trickle-down economics, the Evil Empire. You grew up believing America had won the Cold War before it officially ended. The Berlin Wall fell when you were fourteen—old enough to understand the significance, young enough to assume walls always fall eventually.</p><p>You were eleven when the Challenger exploded. You probably watched it in school, in a classroom with a wheeled-in TV set. Christa McAuliffe was supposed to be the first teacher in space. Instead, she became a cautionary tale about institutional failure and the dangers of ignoring engineers. You learned young that sometimes the adults don't know what they're doing.</p><p>Technology in your childhood was analog and sturdy. Phones were connected to walls. Cameras used film. Research meant encyclopedias and libraries. You had to be home when the streetlights came on because nobody had cell phones. If you wanted to know something, you had to find a book or ask someone who knew.</p><p>Your childhood TV was a mix of reruns and new classics: M*A*S*H, The Love Boat, Diff'rent Strokes, The A-Team. Saturday mornings meant cartoons. Afternoons meant being outside until dinner. Summer meant no air conditioning in most places, just fans and open windows and sweating through everything. You didn't know you were living through the end of the pre-digital era, but you were.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Generation X</h2><p>You're Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980. The forgotten middle child of American generations, sandwiched between the enormous Boomers and the even more enormous Millennials. There are only about 65 million of you in the US, which means you've never had the voting power to get anything you wanted. Welcome to the club.</p><p>Your generation was defined by being left alone. Your parents worked. Divorce rates doubled. You came home to empty houses, made your own snacks, and figured things out without supervision. The term 'latchkey kids' was invented specifically for you. This wasn't trauma at the time—it was just how things were.</p><p>The defining cultural moment for Gen X was the end of the Cold War. You grew up with nuclear annihilation as background noise, did duck-and-cover drills in elementary school, and then watched the whole thing evaporate when you were a teenager. The Berlin Wall fell when you were fourteen. The Soviet Union collapsed when you were sixteen. The enemy you'd been trained to fear just... stopped existing. That does something to your worldview.</p><p>Your generation is characterized by skepticism, irony, and low expectations. You don't trust institutions because you watched them fail repeatedly—Watergate, Iran-Contra, the savings and loan crisis, Enron. You don't expect employers to be loyal because you watched your parents get downsized. You don't expect the government to solve problems because you've seen it create them.</p><p>Gen X invented the ironic detachment that Millennials would later be accused of. You pioneered the knowing smirk, the air quotes, the assumption that everything is slightly fake. This wasn't pessimism—it was self-defense. If you didn't get your hopes up, they couldn't be crushed. Your generation's motto might as well be: 'Whatever.'</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Jaws invented the summer blockbuster and terrified an entire generation out of the ocean. Steven Spielberg made a rubber shark scarier than most real threats. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won Best Picture. The Rocky Horror Picture Show started its eternal midnight movie run. Nashville captured America in three hours of intersecting storylines.</p><p>Musically, 1975 gave you Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run and Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'—two very different approaches to the same question: what do you do when everything feels meaningless? You also got KC and the Sunshine Band, which was the other approach: dance until you forget.</p><p>Your childhood was peak television: Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, The Muppet Show, Three's Company. Your teenage years belonged to MTV, which launched when you were six and defined everything by the time you hit high school. You remember when music videos were new, when Madonna was shocking, when Michael Jackson was just talented instead of tragic.</p><p>You came of age during the alternative rock explosion. Nirvana's Nevermind dropped when you were sixteen. You remember where you were when Kurt Cobain died. Grunge wasn't just music—it was an entire aesthetic of not caring, which perfectly matched your generation's vibe. Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains. Flannel shirts and Doc Martens. Seattle was briefly the center of the universe.</p><p>Your movie years were the golden age of John Hughes: The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink. These films understood teenagers as actual people with actual problems, which was revolutionary at the time. You saw yourself on screen in ways previous generations hadn't. Then you grew up and realized none of those kids would have actually been friends in real life.</p><p>You watched Star Wars in theaters when you were two (probably) and Empire Strikes Back when you were five. The original trilogy was your mythology. When the prequels came out, you were twenty-four—old enough to be disappointed, young enough to still care. That particular wound has never fully healed.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, working on BASIC for the Altair 8800—a computer only hobbyists would want. The personal computer revolution was starting in garages, and you'd grow up alongside it. By the time you graduated high school, computers were everywhere. By the time you hit thirty, they were in your pocket.</p><p>Your childhood was entirely analog. Rotary phones. Typewriters. Card catalogs. If you wanted to change the TV channel, you walked across the room. The remote control was revolutionary when it arrived. Your family probably got cable in the early '80s, which meant suddenly having forty channels instead of four. It felt like infinite content.</p><p>You were ten when the Macintosh launched with that famous Super Bowl commercial. Eleven when Nintendo Entertainment System arrived and saved the video game industry. Twelve when the first computer lab appeared at your school. You learned to type on actual typewriters, then on early PCs with green text on black screens. Oregon Trail was probably your first video game, and you definitely died of dysentery.</p><p>The internet entered your life when you were already an adult. You were nineteen or twenty when the World Wide Web went public. You were in your mid-twenties when Google launched. This matters: you remember life before the internet, which gives you a perspective younger generations literally cannot have. You know what boredom felt like when you couldn't just check your phone.</p><p>You watched the tech boom and bust in real-time. You were twenty-five during the dot-com bubble, probably working at a startup or knowing people who were. You were twenty-six when it all collapsed. You learned that 'new economy' was just 'old economy with better marketing.' That skepticism about tech hype has served you well ever since.</p><p>Your relationship with smartphones is pragmatic. You adopted them because they're useful, not because you can't imagine life without them. You remember when being unreachable was normal, when weekends meant actually being off, when work couldn't follow you home. That memory makes the always-on culture feel like a choice rather than an inevitability.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were four months old when Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War that had defined your parents' generation. The last helicopter lifted off from the embassy roof in April 1975. You don't remember it, but you grew up in its aftermath—the veterans nobody wanted to talk about, the national shame that took decades to process, the movies that wouldn't start coming until you were a teenager.</p><p>You were five when Reagan was shot. Six when AIDS was first identified, though nobody called it that yet. Eight when the Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 American service members. Your childhood was punctuated by violence that adults tried to explain and couldn't.</p><p>You were eleven when the Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after launch. You almost certainly watched it live, in a classroom, because this was supposed to be inspiring—a teacher in space! Instead, you learned that institutions lie, that management overrides engineers, that optimism can kill. That lesson stuck.</p><p>You were fourteen when the Berlin Wall fell. You watched it on TV—people with hammers, chunks of concrete as souvenirs, David Hasselhoff inexplicably singing from a crane. Two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War that had defined your parents' entire lives just... ended. You grew up expecting nuclear apocalypse and got a peace dividend instead. It was disorienting.</p><p>You were sixteen when the Gulf War happened—the first war broadcast live on CNN, complete with night-vision footage that looked like a video game. It was supposed to be quick and clean. 'Smart bombs' would minimize casualties. Vietnam's mistakes wouldn't be repeated. You were young enough to believe some of that.</p><p>You were twenty-six on September 11, 2001. You were at work, or maybe just starting your day, when the first plane hit. By the time the second plane hit, everyone knew this wasn't an accident. You watched the towers fall. You spent the rest of the day trying to reach people, confirm that friends in New York were alive, process something that felt impossible. The world before that morning became a different country.</p><p>You were thirty-three during the 2008 financial crisis. You probably had a mortgage, maybe kids, definitely a 401(k) that lost half its value overnight. You'd finally achieved some stability, and then you watched it nearly collapse. You learned that 'too big to fail' meant the banks got bailed out while regular people lost their homes.</p><p>You were forty-five when COVID hit. You worked from home, worried about aging parents, tried to explain to your kids why they couldn't see friends. You'd lived through enough crises to know this would pass eventually, but that didn't make it easier. It just made you tired.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1997, give or take—right as the dot-com boom was heating up. The economy was good. Jobs were available. If you had any computer skills, companies were throwing money at you. Stock options! Foosball tables! The phrase 'internet millionaire' wasn't ironic yet. Some of you got rich. Most of you didn't, but the optimism was infectious.</p><p>Then 2000 happened, and the bubble burst. Suddenly all those startups with no business models were gone. The Aeron chairs were being sold at liquidation auctions. You learned that 'disruptive' often just meant 'unprofitable.' If you'd been smart or lucky, you cashed out before the crash. If you hadn't, you went back to regular jobs and tried not to think about what might have been.</p><p>Your generation pioneered the work-life balance conversation, mostly because you watched your Boomer bosses sacrifice everything for companies that would downsize them without hesitation. You were the first generation to openly question whether the corporate ladder was worth climbing. The answer, for many of you, was: not if the rungs keep disappearing.</p><p>You were mid-career during the 2008 crash—established enough to have something to lose, young enough that you couldn't just retire early. You watched colleagues get laid off. You took on extra work to prove you were essential. You learned that loyalty flows one direction: up. Companies will always protect themselves before protecting you.</p><p>Your management style, if you made it to management, tends to be hands-off. You give people space because that's what you wanted when you were younger. You don't micromanage because you remember hating it. You're skeptical of corporate jargon because you've seen it used to justify terrible decisions. 'Synergy' usually means layoffs.</p><p>Remote work became normalized when you were forty-five, but you'd been doing versions of it for years. You don't need to be in an office to be productive. You don't need constant supervision. You figured out how to get things done on your own back when you were a latchkey kid. Working from home is just the adult version of that.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You grew up in the divorce boom. Your parents, or your friends' parents, or seemingly everyone's parents, split up during the late '70s and '80s. No-fault divorce became standard. Custody arrangements became normal conversation. You learned early that marriages end, that families reconfigure, that 'forever' is often aspirational.</p><p>This made your generation cautious about commitment. You dated longer before marrying. You cohabitated first to make sure. The idea of marrying your college sweetheart at twenty-two seemed reckless—hadn't you seen what happened to people who did that? Better to wait. Better to be sure. Better to protect yourself.</p><p>You met partners the old-fashioned way: through friends, at bars, at work, in college. Online dating existed by your late twenties, but it was stigmatized. Admitting you met someone on the internet felt embarrassing, like you couldn't find someone in real life. That stigma faded eventually, but you remember when it was there.</p><p>Your communication style bridges two eras. You learned to write letters, then emails, then texts. You can have a phone conversation without anxiety—unlike some younger people who treat phone calls like war crimes. You appreciate the efficiency of texting but remember when reaching someone meant calling their house and hoping they were home.</p><p>If you have kids, they're probably teenagers or young adults now. You're watching them navigate a world you don't fully understand—social media drama, influencer culture, whatever the current platform is. You try to give them the independence you had, but the stakes feel different now. You can't just tell them to be home by dark when dark is whenever they stop staring at screens.</p><p>Your friendships have survived geographic separation, career changes, divorces, deaths. The people who matter have been around for decades. You've lost touch with some. Others you can pick up with exactly where you left off. You don't need to see someone every week to consider them a close friend. Time works differently when you've known someone for forty years.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You came of age during relatively good economic times. The late '90s were prosperous. Jobs existed. If you played your cards right, you could build something. You might have bought a house before they became impossibly expensive. You might have gotten into the stock market before the dot-com crash. Timing matters, and your timing was... mixed.</p><p>The dot-com crash was your first real financial trauma. If you'd invested in tech stocks, you watched them evaporate. If you worked at a startup, you probably lost your job. You learned that bubbles pop, that paper wealth isn't real wealth, that the smart money gets out before the dumb money realizes what's happening.</p><p>You recovered, mostly, and then 2008 hit. You were mid-career, probably with a mortgage, maybe with kids. You watched your 401(k) crater. You watched friends lose houses. You watched banks get bailed out while regular people got nothing. The lesson was clear: the system protects itself, not you.</p><p>Your financial approach tends toward caution. You save more than you spend. You're skeptical of get-rich-quick schemes because you've seen them fail. You invest, but you don't check your portfolio obsessively because you know it'll go up and down and there's not much you can do about it. Long-term thinking is the only thing that works, and even that's not guaranteed.</p><p>You're in your peak earning years now, which is good because everything costs more than it did. You're probably helping kids with college, or helping aging parents, or both. The sandwich generation thing isn't a metaphor—you're literally being squeezed from both directions. Your money goes to other people's needs before it goes to yours.</p><p>Retirement feels possible but not certain. Social Security might be there. Your 401(k) might be enough. The math works on paper, but paper is what burned in 2008. You plan for the best and prepare for the worst, because experience has taught you that the worst happens more often than the optimists admit.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your independence is your greatest strength and your biggest liability. You figured things out on your own because you had to. You don't ask for help because you never learned how. This served you well when institutions were unreliable, but it also means you suffer unnecessarily sometimes. Asking for help isn't weakness—it's efficiency.</p><p>Your ironic detachment can become a prison. Caring about things is risky, so you learned not to care too visibly. But perpetual irony is exhausting, and it makes genuine connection harder. At some point, you have to drop the knowing smirk and actually invest in something. The cool pose gets less cool with age.</p><p>You dismiss younger generations too quickly. Yes, Millennials complain. Yes, Gen Z is confusing. But they're dealing with problems you didn't face: crushing student debt, impossible housing costs, a job market that treats them as disposable. Your 'I figured it out, so can they' attitude ignores that the game changed after you learned the rules.</p><p>Your skepticism of institutions can become reflexive cynicism. Not everything is corrupt. Not everyone in power is lying. Sometimes systems work, sometimes people are sincere, sometimes optimism is warranted. Assuming the worst protects you from disappointment but also prevents you from pushing for things to improve. Cynicism is safe. It's also passive.</p><p>You underestimate how much technology has changed things. You adapted to smartphones and social media, but you don't feel their effects the way younger people do. The loneliness epidemic, the mental health crisis, the way algorithms shape reality—these hit different when you grew up fully immersed. Your 'just put down the phone' advice isn't wrong, but it's also not sufficient.</p><p>Your generation got lucky on timing more than you acknowledge. You bought houses before prices tripled. You started careers before the gig economy precarity became standard. You accumulated assets when accumulation was still possible. Not everyone can bootstrap their way to stability when the boots cost more than anyone can afford.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You graduated into a decent economy and probably found work without too much trouble. The dot-com boom was getting started. If you were tech-adjacent, opportunities were everywhere. You might have taken a startup job with stock options that later became worthless, or cashed out at exactly the right time. Either way, you learned that the economy is a casino where the house always wins eventually. You dated, moved cities, figured out what you wanted from life. This was the decade of possibility, before reality started closing doors.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> You probably settled down, or decided not to. Marriage, kids, mortgage—the traditional markers—happened for some of you. Others chose different paths. The dot-com crash taught you that boom times don't last. By your mid-thirties, you were established enough to weather smaller storms. Then 2008 hit at the very end of this decade, just as you thought you had things figured out. Nothing like a global financial crisis to remind you that stability is temporary.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Recovery decade. You rebuilt what 2008 damaged—retirement accounts, confidence, the belief that planning matters. Your kids, if you had them, were growing up. Your parents were aging. You became the responsible adult in the room whether you wanted to or not. Career-wise, you either made it to management or decided you didn't want to. The corporate ladder looked less appealing from halfway up. COVID hit at the end, sending everyone home and reshuffling everything again.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> You're in this decade now or approaching it. Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. Your kids are launching into a world that's harder than the one you entered. Your parents need more help. You're thinking about retirement but not sure you can afford it, or not sure what you'd do with yourself. You've lived through enough disruption to know more is coming. The question isn't whether the next crisis happens, but what form it takes.</p><p><strong>Your 60s ({{SIXTIES_START}}+):</strong> Retirement, maybe. Or maybe semi-retirement—working less, choosing projects, staying engaged. Social Security will probably exist but probably won't be enough. Your health matters more now. The friends who matter have been around for decades. You've earned the right to not care what people think, to say no to things you don't want to do, to spend your time on what actually matters. You've survived recessions, pandemics, wars, technological revolutions. Whatever comes next, you'll probably survive that too.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.1 million people born in 1975. Generation X as a whole is about 65 million Americans—the smallest generation wedged between two giants. You've never had the political power of Boomers or the cultural weight of Millennials. You've been overlooked your entire life, which is fine by you. Attention isn't everything.</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), you're less idealistic and more pragmatic. They protested. You adapted. They believed they could change the world. You believed you could survive it. Boomers got affordable college, cheap houses, pensions, and then pulled the ladder up behind them. You got student loans, expensive real estate, and 401(k)s that might or might not be enough. They had Woodstock. You had Lollapalooza, which was trying too hard to be Woodstock.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you're more self-reliant and less anxious. You didn't grow up with participation trophies. You didn't have helicopter parents. You were left alone, and you turned out okay—or at least okay enough. Millennials got the 2008 crash right as they entered the workforce. You got it mid-career, which hurt but didn't define you. They expect institutions to work. You expect them to fail.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're analogs in a digital world. They've never known life without the internet. You remember rotary phones. They grew up with social media shaping their identity. You formed your identity first, then got social media. They're anxious in ways that mystify you. You're dismissive in ways that frustrate them. Neither of you is entirely wrong.</p><p>Your life expectancy is around 78-80 years, though 'deaths of despair'—suicide, overdose, alcoholism—have hit Gen X harder than previous generations. The ironic detachment has a cost. The independence can become isolation. The skepticism can curdle into nihilism. Your generation's strength is also its weakness: you're so good at not needing anyone that sometimes you forget you actually do.</p><p>But you've also built lives with less institutional support than any generation before you. You adapted to change without complaining too loudly. You raised kids while working, cared for parents while saving for retirement, weathered crises that would have broken softer generations. You're not flashy. You don't ask for recognition. You just get things done. That's been your way from the beginning.</p>"
