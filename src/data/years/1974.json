      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1974-1986</h2><p>The smell of Big Wheels on hot asphalt. The satisfying click of Weebles that wobbled but didn't fall down. The weight of an Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle in your hands, winding up that gyro motor until it screamed. Your childhood had a texture that kids today will never understand—everything was mechanical, tangible, dangerous in ways that built character.</p><p>Nixon resigned the year you were born, waving from that helicopter like he was headed to a resort instead of historical exile. Gerald Ford pardoned him before you could crawl. Your first lesson in American civics: accountability is optional if you're powerful enough. The Watergate hearings played on the TV while your parents changed your diapers. Somewhere in your infant brain, cynicism was taking root.</p><p>At three, you were watching Schoolhouse Rock between Saturday morning cartoons—learning how a bill becomes a law from a singing scroll, absorbing grammar from 'Conjunction Junction.' At five, you knew all the words to 'I'm Just a Bill' but had no idea what Congress actually did. You still don't, probably, but at least you can unpack an adverb.</p><p>Your toys were glorious and occasionally lethal. Hot Wheels tracks that doubled as sibling weapons. Stretch Armstrong that you eventually pulled apart to see what was inside (corn syrup and disappointment). Lite-Brite with those tiny pegs that ended up embedded in carpet fibers forever. Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots that taught you the joy of mechanical violence. Lawn darts that were literally banned by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</p><p>Friday nights meant one thing: The Love Boat at 9, Fantasy Island at 10. You'd beg to stay up late enough for 'Da plane! Da plane!' Saturday mornings were sacred—a bowl of Count Chocula or Franken Berry, parked in front of the TV watching Super Friends, Scooby-Doo, and Land of the Lost. No parents. No supervision. Just you and the Sleestaks.</p><p>At seven, you watched the first Space Shuttle launch. At eight, E.T. made everyone cry, and you probably had the lunchbox, the Reese's Pieces addiction, and a complicated relationship with government scientists. At twelve, the Challenger disaster imprinted itself on your memory—a moment that would stay with you, the first time you understood that even triumphant moments could end in tragedy.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Gen X</h2><p>Generation X. The name came from a Douglas Coupland novel, and it stuck because nobody could think of anything better. You're the middle child of American demographics—<span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> people sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials. You've spent your entire life being overlooked, which suits you fine. You'd rather be underestimated than overhyped.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Nixon resigned four months after you were born.</span> The defining characteristic of your generation is that nobody defined you at all. You were the first latchkey kids. Your parents were at work, or divorced, or both. You let yourself in after school with a key on a string around your neck, made your own Kraft mac and cheese, and watched reruns until someone came home. This wasn't neglect—it was the '70s. Free-range parenting before anyone named it. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span> It made you self-reliant in ways that border on pathological.</p><p>Your defining moment came at twelve: the Challenger exploded on live television. January 28, 1986. Christa McAuliffe, the teacher-astronaut, was supposed to inspire a generation. Instead, you watched the shuttle break apart seventy-three seconds after launch. The O-ring failed. The institution failed. You watched your teacher's face crumble, and you learned that even NASA could be catastrophically wrong, that heroes could die while you watched, that triumphant moments could end in tragedy without warning.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Your generation watched institutions fail in real-time. Watergate proved the president could be a criminal. Vietnam proved the government could lie about a war for a decade. The oil crisis proved that abundance wasn't guaranteed. Three Mile Island proved that technology could betray you. You learned early that authority figures were fallible, that systems were unreliable, that the only person you could really count on was yourself.</p><p>Gen X invented irony as a lifestyle. Sincerity was for suckers. Cool was not caring, or at least pretending not to. You perfected the art of the sardonic comment, the raised eyebrow, the whatever shrug. This was armor. If you didn't care, you couldn't be hurt. If you mocked everything, nothing could mock you first. <span class=\"hero-callout\">You can still entertain yourself without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The Godfather Part II came out the year you were born—proof that sequels could surpass originals, which Hollywood immediately forgot and spent the next fifty years failing to replicate. Chinatown taught audiences that sometimes the bad guys win. Blazing Saddles was offensive in ways that would get a movie canceled today. Young Frankenstein proved Mel Brooks could do anything. People magazine launched, beginning the celebrity industrial complex that would eventually consume all media.</p><p>Musically, 1974 was the year disco started its hostile takeover. Barry White was everywhere, growling about love in that impossibly deep voice. ABBA won Eurovision with 'Waterloo' and began their campaign to make every human on Earth know the words to 'Dancing Queen.' John Denver was singing about Rocky Mountain highs. KC and the Sunshine Band wanted you to shake your booty. The Ramones formed in a Queens basement, planting seeds for punk that wouldn't bloom until you were old enough to appreciate it.</p><p>At three, you were dancing to 'Saturday Night Fever' without understanding what any of it meant. At five, you probably owned a pair of those tiny Bee Gees-style white suits. At seven, 'Grease' had everyone convinced that high school would involve leather jackets and choreographed dance numbers. At ten, 'Thriller' changed everything—you remember exactly where you were when you first saw that video. Michael Jackson transformed in front of you, and so did music.</p><p>Your childhood TV was Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Six Million Dollar Man. You wanted to be Steve Austin. You made the bionic sound effect when you ran. You probably asked for the action figure with the bionic eye you could look through. At eight, Dallas premiered, and suddenly everyone wanted to know who shot J.R. At eleven, you watched Luke Skywalker learn the truth about his father and felt something in your chest that you still can't name.</p><p>Then MTV launched when you were seven. August 1, 1981. 'Video Killed the Radio Star' by the Buggles—the first video ever played on the network that would define your adolescence. By twelve, you knew every word to 'Like a Virgin,' could do the Moonwalk (badly), and had opinions about whether Van Halen was better with David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar. The answer was Roth. It's always Roth.</p><p>High school was The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink. John Hughes understood you in ways your parents never would. You saw yourself in those characters—the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, the criminal. By the time you graduated, you'd transitioned to grunge. Nirvana's 'Nevermind' dropped when you were seventeen. Flannel wasn't just fashion—it was identity. You smelled like teen spirit whether you wanted to or not.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The sound of a rotary phone is burned into your muscle memory. That satisfying resistance as you dragged the dial around, the whirr as it returned. If someone's number had a lot of 9s and 0s, you actually had to want to call them. Long distance cost money, so you kept it brief. 'It's expensive!' your mom would yell from the kitchen. You learned to communicate efficiently.</p><p>At three, you probably watched your first VCR demonstration at a department store. The idea of recording television was science fiction. At six, your family might have gotten one—a top-loader the size of a small suitcase, with a wired remote on a twenty-foot cable. By eight, you'd mastered the blinking 12:00. Nobody else in the family could program it. This was your first taste of technological superiority over adults.</p><p>Atari changed everything. You were five when the 2600 launched, and suddenly the TV wasn't just for watching—it was for doing. Pong was two rectangles and a square, but it was mesmerizing. Combat. Space Invaders. Pitfall. Pac-Man (the terrible home version). You played until your thumbs blistered. You blew on cartridges when they wouldn't work. You learned that hitting things sometimes fixed them.</p><p>At nine, the IBM PC arrived. At eleven, Apple ran the '1984' Super Bowl commercial. At thirteen, you were probably in a computer lab learning BASIC on machines that cost more than your parents' car. PRINT 'HELLO WORLD.' FOR/NEXT loops. The cursor blinking green on black, waiting for you to tell it what to do. This was power.</p><p>You were twenty-one when the World Wide Web went public. Twenty-four when Amazon launched. Twenty-six when Google started. Thirty when Facebook opened. Thirty-three when the iPhone arrived. You didn't grow up with the internet—you watched it being built. You remember life before email, before URLs, before everything was connected. This gives you perspective that younger generations can't access.</p><p>You're the bridge generation. You can explain modems to Boomers and TikTok to your kids. You remember when 'logging on' was an event, when you had to wait for dial-up to screech its handshake, when a single image could take minutes to load. You use technology as a tool, not a habitat. You can put your phone down. You know what boredom feels like. These are superpowers now.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Nixon resigned four months after you were born</span>—August 8, 1974. Your parents watched it live, the only president in American history to quit the job. Gerald Ford took over and promptly pardoned Nixon, teaching you before you could walk that the powerful play by different rules. You don't remember any of it, but the cynicism seeped into the water supply.</p><p>At one, Saigon fell. The Vietnam War ended with helicopters evacuating the embassy roof, with desperate people clinging to skids. You don't remember it, but the veterans were everywhere—your uncles, your neighbors, guys at the gas station who seemed older than they were. The war shaped your parents. Its aftermath shaped you.</p><p>At three, Elvis died. You don't remember that either, but you know the footage—the crowds at Graceland, the weeping fans, the drug-bloated body discovered by his girlfriend. The King was dead at forty-two. Rock and roll's first warning about excess.</p><p>At five, the Iran hostage crisis began. For <span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days, Americans were held captive—a nightly reminder that American power had limits.</p><p>At seven, Ronald Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton. At eight, John Lennon was murdered outside the Dakota. At twelve, the Challenger disaster became your generation's shared trauma—the shuttle broke apart while classrooms across America watched live.</p><p>At fifteen, the Berlin Wall fell. November 9, 1989. You watched it live—crowds with sledgehammers, champagne, tears. The Cold War that had defined your entire childhood just... ended. The threat that made you practice hiding under your desk evaporated. You were supposed to feel relief. Mostly, you felt disoriented. What do you worry about when the apocalypse gets canceled?</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> You were probably at work. You were old enough to have a career, maybe a mortgage, possibly kids. Old enough to understand that the world had fundamentally changed, that the peace dividend was over, that a new era of permanent anxiety had begun. At thirty-four, the financial system collapsed. At forty-six, a pandemic shut down the world. You've lived through more 'unprecedented' events than your parents' generation saw in their entire lives.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce between 1992 and 1996, depending on whether you went to college. The timing was impeccable. The economy was expanding. The internet was creating jobs that hadn't existed five years earlier. You could negotiate salary because employers needed workers. Unemployment was low. Optimism was high. You could be picky.</p><p>You're the generation that watched the social contract between employers and employees get shredded, but you caught the tail end of when it still meant something. You started your career when pensions still existed, when health insurance was expected, when 'company loyalty' wasn't yet an oxymoron. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> You'll end it in the gig economy, dependent on a 401(k) that moves with the market's mood.</p><p>The dot-com boom made everyone feel like a genius. You were twenty-five when Amazon IPO'd. Twenty-six when Google launched. You probably knew someone who got rich on stock options. You might have been that someone. You definitely watched the bubble inflate, participated in the irrational exuberance, believed that this time was different. Then March 2000 happened, and trillions evaporated. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> The bust taught you that disruption usually means someone's about to get disrupted out of a job.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived.</span> You're now in leadership positions—VP, Director, maybe C-suite if you played your cards right. You're sandwiched between Boomers who refuse to retire and Millennials who want to work differently. You're the translator, explaining each generation to the other while trying to get actual work done. Boomers want face time and hierarchy. Millennials want flexibility and meaning. You just want everyone to answer their emails.</p><p>Your management style was shaped by terrible managers. You had a boss who took credit for your work, another who micromanaged everything, another who got promoted for being loud rather than competent. You learned what not to do. You value competence over credentials, results over process. You're suspicious of corporate speak, team-building exercises, and anyone who uses 'synergy' without irony.</p><p>COVID proved you could work from anywhere, which means now you're expected to work from everywhere. The office is in your pocket. The boundary between work and life isn't blurred—it's gone. You're answering Slack at midnight, taking calls on vacation, always available because that's what availability means now. You adapted. You always adapt. That's the problem.</p>"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when having a crush meant memorizing their locker combination, their class schedule, the exact moment they'd walk past the water fountain? When getting their phone number required asking—out loud, in person, with witnesses? When calling meant talking to their dad first, who definitely didn't approve of whatever you were about?</p><p>You're the last generation to date entirely offline. You met people at parties, at bars, through friends, at work. You asked for phone numbers on napkins. You waited by the phone—the landline, attached to the wall, with a cord you stretched into the closet for privacy. No caller ID. Every ring was a possibility. The anticipation was half the romance.</p><p>You probably got married in your mid-to-late twenties. The average age at first marriage for your cohort was 26 for men, 24 for women—later than Boomers, earlier than Millennials. Divorce rates peaked just before you hit marrying age, so you'd seen what happened when marriages failed. Many of you lived it. Children of divorce recognize each other. The shared understanding doesn't need words.</p><p>Your generation quietly normalized couples therapy. You read the books—Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Everything Oprah recommended. You talked about feelings, which your parents never did. You did 'the work,' which is a phrase that would have confused your grandparents entirely. Relationships were projects that required maintenance. You maintained.</p><p>Communication evolved dramatically during your adult life. You went from landlines to car phones (that bag in the trunk) to flip phones to smartphones. From letters to email to texts to DMs. You remember when a phone call was the default and a letter was special. Now a phone call is intrusive and nobody writes letters. You adapted to every new platform, but part of you still thinks voice is more personal than text.</p><p>Your friendships are low-maintenance by design. You have group chats with people you've known for thirty years. You can go months without talking and pick up exactly where you left off. Gen X friendship doesn't require constant maintenance. You're all too busy, too scattered, too independent for that. You show up when it matters. That's enough.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You grew up during stagflation—the worst of both worlds. High inflation. High unemployment. Your parents talked about money constantly because there never seemed to be enough. Gas lines. Layoffs. The 'malaise' speech. WIN buttons ('Whip Inflation Now'—they didn't). Mortgage rates hit <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span> in 1981. You learned early that economic security was a polite fiction.</p><p>But then you caught a break. You entered the workforce when houses were affordable—median price around $120,000 in 1995, when your starting salary might have been $25,000-40,000. The math worked. You could save for a down payment. You could actually buy something. This wasn't virtue. It was timing. You happened to be the right age when prices hadn't yet gone insane.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during your prime earning years.</span> The 2008 crisis hit you mid-career. You were thirty-four, probably with a mortgage, maybe kids, definitely a 401(k) that had been doing well. Then Lehman collapsed and everything followed. The market dropped <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span>. You watched your retirement account crater. You watched friends lose houses. You watched the banks get bailed out while homeowners got austerity. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> The lesson was the same one Watergate taught: the system protects its own.</p><p>You got 401(k)s instead of pensions, which was a worse deal but still a deal. You're the last generation that could build wealth through conventional means. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> The safety net was already fraying when you reached for it, but at least it was still there.</p><p>Your relationship with money is practical to the point of paranoia. You save because you've seen how fast things collapse. You're skeptical of bubbles—dot-com, housing, crypto—because you've watched them pop. You don't trust that anything will last. You probably have more in savings than strictly necessary, because 'strictly necessary' depends on whether the floor holds.</p><p>You're the generation that will inherit from Boomers—the largest intergenerational wealth transfer in history. Some of you will receive significant inheritances. Many won't. The gap between prosperous Gen Xers and struggling ones will widen. Your generation's financial story isn't one story. It's two: those who caught the last wave and those who didn't.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your greatest strength is your greatest weakness: independence that curdles into isolation. You're so used to figuring things out alone that you don't ask for help when you need it. You don't burden others. You handle it. You've always handled it. This is admirable until it becomes pathological—until you're drowning and too proud to wave.</p><p>You've perfected the art of not caring, or pretending not to. Ironic detachment was your survival mechanism. Sincerity felt dangerous, so you armored yourself with sarcasm. The problem is that armor keeps things out and in. You can critique everything and commit to nothing. You're so busy being too cool to try that you miss opportunities for genuine engagement.</p><p>Your generation is invisible in ways that have cost you. You're not large enough to dominate like Boomers. You're not young enough to represent the future like Millennials and Gen Z. Policy debates happen around you, not about you. Marketing ignores you. Politicians don't court your vote the way they court everyone else's. You've adapted to being overlooked, but adaptation isn't acceptance.</p><p>You're cynical about institutions in ways that become self-defeating. Voting seems pointless, so you don't vote, which makes it actually pointless. Organizing seems futile, so you don't organize, which makes change less likely. Your skepticism is earned—you watched every institution fail—but it's also a cage. Sometimes cynicism is just giving up with extra steps.</p><p>You've normalized overwork as identity. You invented 'work hard, play hard,' which meant 'work hard, then work more.' You measure yourself by productivity. You don't know how to rest without guilt. Vacation feels like truancy. You've confused exhaustion with virtue. Millennials get criticized for hustle culture, but you built the prototype. They just branded it.</p><p>And here's the deepest blind spot: you've mistaken going it alone for strength. Your latchkey independence became a philosophy. But no one succeeds entirely alone, and refusing help isn't self-reliance—it's just isolation with better PR. The kid with the key around their neck grew up, but they never fully learned to ask for what they need.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1994-2004):</strong> The timing was perfect. The economy expanded. Jobs were available. You could negotiate because employers needed you. Some of you rode the dot-com rocket—stock options, IPO dreams, the fantasy that this time was different. Then March 2000, and trillions vanished. You learned that markets lie. But you were young enough to recover, and there was time. Your twenties were the last decade when optimism still made sense.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2004-2014):</strong> You hit your stride and then the floor collapsed. The 2008 crisis gutted everything. Houses underwater. Retirement accounts halved. Friends laid off, foreclosed, broken. The recovery was slow and uneven, and if you kept your job, you felt grateful in ways that embarrassed you. You had kids, mortgages, responsibilities. You learned that the economy could betray you at any age. You also learned resilience, because what choice did you have?</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2014-2024):</strong> This is where you are now, or just finishing. Peak earning years, peak responsibility years. Kids are teenagers or launched. Parents are aging, needing more. You're sandwiched—managing up and down, responsible for everyone, seen by no one. You have authority at work but wonder if the young people respect you or just tolerate you. You have perspective but no one asks for it.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2024-2034):</strong> The next decade. Kids will be independent, or independent-ish. Parents may be gone or going. You'll have more time and less energy—the cruelest trade life offers. Retirement will start feeling real instead of theoretical. You'll calculate whether you have enough. The answer will probably be 'maybe, if nothing goes wrong.' Nothing has ever gone wrong, you'll tell yourself, knowing that's not true.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2034+):</strong> Retirement, if you can afford it. Social Security will probably exist but pay less. Medicare will probably exist but cover less. The world will be unrecognizable—climate changed, technology advanced, demographics shifted. You'll tell younger people about rotary phones and three TV channels and video stores. They'll think you're describing ancient history. You won't entirely disagree.</p>"
