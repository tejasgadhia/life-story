      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1946-1958</h2><p>The smell of your mother's Victory Garden, not quite abandoned yet. Spam sandwiches on Wonder Bread. The crackle of the Philco radio in the living room, your whole family gathered around it like a campfire. Your childhood had a sound—the hiss and pop of AM broadcasts, the tinny theme songs of The Shadow and Fibber McGee and Molly drifting through screen doors on summer evenings.</p><p>At five, you were playing with Lincoln Logs, building frontier cabins on the living room floor while your father read the newspaper in his armchair. Tinker Toys for the mechanically minded. Erector Sets if your family had the money. Your Radio Flyer wagon was your vehicle of choice—hauling rocks, giving rides to the neighbor kids, racing down hills with no regard for safety because safety wasn't invented yet.</p><p>You were six when I Love Lucy premiered, and suddenly every household wanted a television set. Your family might have been the first on the block, or you might have crowded into the neighbor's living room every Tuesday night. Howdy Doody was on at 5:30, Kukla, Fran and Ollie before dinner. The test pattern at night, that Indian head staring back at you, meant the world had gone to bed.</p><p>Your toys were physical, imaginative, slightly dangerous. Cap guns that actually sparked. Chemistry sets with real chemicals. BB guns at eight if your father thought you were ready. You played outside until the streetlights came on—no supervision, no schedule, just the freedom of a generation whose parents were too relieved the war was over to hover.</p><p>At seven, you did duck-and-cover drills at school, hiding under your wooden desk as if it could protect you from atomic fire. The teacher didn't explain why. The filmstrip showed a cartoon turtle. You learned to live with existential dread before you learned long division. The bomb was always there, humming beneath the optimism like a basement furnace that might explode.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year you were born, Bing Crosby was everywhere—his voice coming out of every radio, every jukebox, every department store speaker. 'White Christmas' was already a classic. The Andrews Sisters harmonized on 'Rum and Coca-Cola.' Perry Como crooned. Big bands were still swinging, but the war that made them essential was over. The music was about to change.</p><p>Your actual pop culture awakening started with radio serials. The Lone Ranger at 7:30, that 'Hi-yo, Silver!' sending you galloping around the backyard. The Shadow, whose power to cloud men's minds seemed genuinely plausible at five years old. Superman on the radio—you believed a man could fly before you ever saw it.</p><p>At six, television arrived like a spaceship in your living room. Milton Berle on Tuesday nights—'Mr. Television' himself—and your whole neighborhood crowded around whoever had a set. Arthur Godfrey. Sid Caesar. The Texaco Star Theatre. By eight, you were watching Dragnet, memorizing 'Just the facts, ma'am.' By ten, Davy Crockett had every kid in America wearing a coonskin cap. You probably had one. You definitely wanted one.</p><p>Then Elvis. You were ten years old in 1956 when he appeared on Ed Sullivan, shot only from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous for America. Your parents were horrified. You were transformed. 'Heartbreak Hotel,' 'Hound Dog,' 'Don't Be Cruel'—this wasn't your parents' music. This was yours. Rock and roll drew a line between generations, and you were on the right side of it.</p><p>By high school, Chuck Berry was doing his duck walk, Little Richard was screaming 'Tutti Frutti,' and Buddy Holly was making music that wouldn't sound dated sixty years later. James Dean died at twenty-four, becoming immortal. Marilyn Monroe was on every magazine cover. You were teenagers at the exact moment teenager became a market category, a cultural identity, a force that adults feared and advertisers courted.</p><p>At seventeen, West Side Story was on Broadway. The Twilight Zone premiered. Motown started in Detroit. The Fifties were ending, and the Sixties were about to arrive with everything they'd bring—but you'd be there for all of it, young enough to dance and old enough to understand what was happening.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year you were born, ENIAC—the first general-purpose computer—was unveiled at the University of Pennsylvania. It weighed thirty tons, filled a room, and could do math faster than any human. You wouldn't touch a computer for another forty years. Technology in 1946 meant rotary phones with party lines, where Mrs. Henderson down the street could listen to your conversations. It meant typewriters and carbon paper. It meant radio—the internet of your childhood, connecting you to the world beyond your neighborhood.</p><p>At eight, your family might have gotten their first television—a Philco or RCA with a screen the size of a dinner plate, furniture built around it like a shrine. Reception was terrible. Rabbit ears needed constant adjustment. The picture rolled. None of that mattered. You were watching moving pictures in your living room. It was magic.</p><p>At eleven, you watched history from the couch. October 4, 1957: Sputnik. The Soviets put a satellite in space while you were doing homework. The beep-beep-beep signal they broadcast was picked up by ham radio operators across America. Your parents were terrified. You were fascinated. Space wasn't science fiction anymore.</p><p>At twelve, NASA was founded. At thirteen, you watched the Mercury Seven become celebrities. At seventeen, John Glenn orbited the Earth three times, and your entire school gathered around televisions to watch the recovery. At twenty-three, you saw Neil Armstrong step onto the moon—live, in your living room, with 600 million other people. 'One small step for man.' You were there. You remember exactly where you were sitting.</p><p>The technological arc of your life is unprecedented in human history. Born before penicillin was widely available, before polio vaccines, before transistors. You learned to type on manual typewriters, calculated with slide rules, researched in card catalogs. You got your first color TV around thirty. Your first microwave around forty. Your first personal computer, if you got one at all, in your fifties or sixties. Email after retirement. Smartphones in your seventies.</p><p>You've watched technology go from vacuum tubes to quantum computing, from party lines to video calls with grandchildren on the other side of the planet. You learned to adapt because the alternative was being left behind. The grandkids might have to show you how to use the iPad, but you watched humanity land on the moon. You saw the future arrive. You're still seeing it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were you when you learned the Soviets had the bomb? You were three, probably too young to understand, but you felt it—the shift in the adults around you, the way conversations stopped when you entered the room. August 1949. The American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted exactly four years. The arms race that would define your entire life had begun.</p><p>At four, North Korea invaded South Korea. Your father's friends, the same men who'd just come home from World War II, were being called up again. Korea was the first war of the Cold War—a template for conflicts that would stretch across decades. Thirty-six thousand Americans died. The peninsula remains divided today.</p><p>At seven, the Korean War ended in stalemate. At eight, Brown v. Board of Education declared segregated schools unconstitutional—though you might not have noticed, depending on where you lived. At nine, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, and something shifted in the country. At ten, the Little Rock Nine integrated Central High School while the National Guard stood watch. You were learning to see your country more clearly.</p><p>At eleven, Sputnik crossed the sky. America was behind. Your teachers started emphasizing math and science like national security depended on it—because it did. At twelve, NASA was founded. At thirteen, Fidel Castro took Cuba. The Cold War had come to the Caribbean.</p><p>At fourteen, John F. Kennedy was inaugurated. 'Ask not what your country can do for you.' You believed it. At fifteen, the Bay of Pigs failed. At sixteen, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the edge of nuclear war—thirteen days in October when everything you knew might have ended. You remember the fear. You remember waiting.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At seventeen, Kennedy was assassinated. November 22, 1963. You remember where you were. Everyone your age does.</span> The principal's voice over the intercom, or the teacher crying, or the television in the store window. Something broke that day. The optimism of your childhood cracked, and it never fully healed.</p><p>At eighteen, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam. At nineteen, you were draft-eligible. Some of you went—55,000 names eventually carved into black granite. Some protested. Some dodged. All of you were shaped by it. Vietnam was your generation's defining wound, a war that divided families and destroyed faith in institutions.</p><p>At twenty-three, you watched Apollo 11 land on the moon. For one moment, the country unified. Then back to earth: at twenty-eight, Watergate. At thirty-three, Saigon fell. At thirty-seven, the Iran hostage crisis. At forty, Reagan was shot. At forty-five, the Berlin Wall fell—the Cold War you'd lived under your entire adult life suddenly, impossibly over. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At sixty-two, the financial crash. At seventy-four, COVID-19. History kept happening. You kept watching. You're still watching.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1964 or 1968, depending on whether you went to college. Either way, you walked into the greatest economic expansion in human history. Europe and Japan were still rebuilding from rubble. American manufacturing had no real competition. A high school diploma could get you a job at the plant that would support a family of four, a house, a car, and a vacation every summer. A college degree made you management material. The American Dream wasn't a slogan—it was a business plan that actually worked.</p><p>The social contract between employer and employee was real. You joined a company expecting to stay for decades; the company expected to keep you. IBM. General Motors. AT&T. U.S. Steel. These weren't just employers—they were institutions that provided identity, community, health insurance, and a pension. You gave them your loyalty; they gave you a gold watch and a retirement you could count on.</p><p>Your resume probably shows one employer, maybe two or three. Job-hopping wasn't a career strategy—it was a character flaw. You climbed the ladder: assistant, associate, manager, director. Each rung meant more money, more responsibility, more security. The rules were clear. Follow them, work hard, and you'd be taken care of. Most of you were.</p><p>If you were a woman, the rules were different. You could be a teacher, a nurse, a secretary—careers that were respected but underpaid, essential but undervalued. The women's movement opened doors in the 1970s, but you'd already made your choices by then. Some of you broke through anyway. Most accommodated a system that limited your options while praising your contributions. The women's work that kept households running was never counted in GDP.</p><p>If you were a man, the deal was straightforward: provide. Work defined you. Your job was your identity. Retirement at sixty-five was a reward earned through decades of showing up, and the pension made it possible to actually stop. You're one of the last generations for whom that arithmetic worked—defined-benefit plans, Social Security that paid out more than you put in, home equity that multiplied while you slept.</p><p>The 401(k) was invented in 1978, when you were thirty-two. It was supposed to supplement pensions, not replace them. But you probably got both. The generations that followed got spreadsheets and hope. The social contract you worked under was shredded after you left the workforce—but it held long enough for you.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents remembered everything. Bread lines. Bank failures. Soup kitchens. The neighbor who lost the farm. The relative who never recovered. The Depression didn't just shape their finances—it shaped their souls, and they passed that down to you. Save for a rainy day. Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without. Never throw away string. Never waste food. Money in the mattress is money you can trust.</p><p>But you also lived through the greatest economic expansion in human history. Your parents' caution met postwar abundance, and the combination made you wealthy almost by accident. Houses cost twice the median income in the 1960s—not six times, like today. You bought your first home for $15,000, maybe $25,000, on a single salary with a reasonable mortgage. That house is now worth $400,000, $600,000, a million depending on where you bought. You didn't do anything special. You just bought property when property was affordable and held it while it appreciated.</p><p>The math tells the story—and the comparison section lays it out in detail. You're not richer because you worked harder. You're richer because you were born into an economy that worked. Rising tides lifted your boat. Then the tides stopped rising.</p><p>The 1970s gave you stagflation—inflation over 10%, gas lines, the sense that the postwar party was over. But you were established. You had equity. You weathered it. The 1987 crash was terrifying for forty-eight hours, then recovered. The 2008 crisis hit your retirement accounts, but Social Security held, your pension (if you had one) held, and your house—your house just kept appreciating.</p><p>Your financial psychology is a contradiction you've learned to live with. The scarcity mindset from your parents. The abundance reality from your own experience. You clip coupons and own three properties. You worry about Social Security while collecting more than you contributed. You tell your grandchildren to work hard and save, not quite understanding that the equation you solved no longer balances for them.</p><p>The wealth you've accumulated will shape American inequality for generations. Whether you give it to your children, leave it to your grandchildren, spend it on cruises, or donate it to charity—these decisions matter more than you might realize. You're the richest generation in American history, sitting on the largest intergenerational wealth transfer ever. What happens next is partly up to you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1966-1976):</strong> History came at you like a firehose. Civil rights. Vietnam. Assassinations—JFK when you were seventeen, then MLK and RFK when you were twenty-two. The Summer of Love. Woodstock. The Moon landing. Nixon. Watergate. You married younger than any generation since—median age of twenty-one for women, twenty-three for men. You had kids before you fully understood what adulthood meant, because that's what you did. The script was clear even as the world around you burned.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1976-1986):</strong> You settled into careers and mortgages while America seemed to lose its way. Stagflation. Gas lines. The Iran hostage crisis. Disco died. Reagan was elected. You were building families, coaching Little League, attending PTA meetings while the institutions you'd trusted—the presidency, the church, the company—revealed themselves as fallible. The Bicentennial came and went. Your kids discovered MTV. You bought a VCR and wondered what the world was coming to.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1986-1996):</strong> Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. Your careers crested. Your kids became teenagers with their own problems, their own music, their own incomprehensible slang. The Berlin Wall fell when you were forty-three—the Cold War you'd lived under your entire adult life just... ended. The Soviet Union collapsed. History was supposed to be over. You started thinking about retirement, even if it felt decades away. The internet arrived, though you weren't sure what it was for.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (1996-2006):</strong> Your kids left home. Your parents needed help. You were sandwiched between generations, managing up and down simultaneously. Some of you divorced. Some reinvented yourselves. Some doubled down on the life you'd built. September 11, 2001: you were fifty-five, watching the towers fall, understanding instantly that the world had changed again. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The housing bubble inflating. You started thinking seriously about when, not if, to retire.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and 70s (2006-2026):</strong> The 2008 crash hit your retirement accounts, but your house held value, your Social Security arrived on schedule, and you had options your children don't. You retired into a world unrecognizable from the one you were born into. Smartphones. Social media. Grandchildren who never knew a world without the internet. COVID-19 at seventy-four—a pandemic that hit your generation hardest, that forced isolation and fear and a reckoning with mortality. You're in your late seventies now, the oldest surviving Boomers, carrying memories of mid-century America that fewer people each year can verify. You remember radio dramas, rotary phones, segregated water fountains, the day Kennedy died. You're living history. Soon, you'll be history.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The name came from the birth surge that started the year you were born—1946, when the GIs came home and America started making families like it was a national project. You're the original Boomer, the very first year of the cohort, born into a country that had just saved the world and was ready to enjoy the spoils.</p><p>There are <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> of you, give or take. The largest generation in American history until Millennials edged past in raw numbers. But you've controlled more wealth, more political power, and more cultural real estate than any generation before or since. Every president from Clinton through Biden has been a Boomer. You've run the country for thirty years. You're still running it.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964—a massive cohort with internal divisions as sharp as any generational gap. You're a 'first-wave' Boomer, born in the immediate postwar surge. You were already a teenager when the youngest Boomers were born. You went to Woodstock; they went to disco. You protested Vietnam; they don't remember it. The Boomer label covers multitudes, but you're the prototype.</p><p>You were the first mass youth culture. Before you, 'teenager' wasn't really a category. You invented it—or at least, marketers invented it to sell to you. Rock and roll was your music. Blue jeans were your uniform. Rebellion was your brand, even when the rebellion was mostly aesthetic. You believed you could change the world. For a moment, it looked like you might.</p><p>The Sixties defined you. Civil rights, the sexual revolution, Vietnam, the counterculture—you were young enough to participate and old enough to understand. Some of you marched on Washington. Some of you went to Vietnam. Some of you did both. The culture wars that still divide America started in your living rooms, at your dinner tables, between you and your parents.</p><p>Then you grew up. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The hippies became stockbrokers. The activists became executives. The revolution was televised, monetized, and eventually abandoned.</span> You're now accused of selling out everything you once stood for—taking the ladders you climbed and pulling them up behind you. That's not entirely fair. It's not entirely unfair either.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when courting meant asking permission to call? When her father answered the phone and you had to make conversation before she'd come on the line? When a date meant picking her up at the door, shaking hands with her parents, promising to have her home by ten? The rules were strict, elaborate, and everyone knew them.</p><p>You married young by today's standards—twenty-one for women, twenty-three for men on average. The sexual revolution was coming, but you were probably engaged before it arrived, or married shortly after. The Pill changed everything, but slowly. Your older siblings followed the old rules. Your younger ones broke them. You were somewhere in the transition.</p><p>Divorce was shameful when you got married; it was common by the time your own kids were teenagers. Your generation normalized ending unhappy marriages—for better and worse. Some of you stayed in marriages that suffocated you because that's what people did. Some of you divorced and started over, sometimes more than once. The stigma faded. The pain didn't.</p><p>You've had to learn new languages of intimacy. Your children wanted to 'process feelings' and 'communicate openly'—therapy-speak that sounded like a foreign language. Your grandchildren date through apps you've never heard of, following rules that seem like no rules at all. Gender roles you thought were eternal turned out to be historical. The world kept changing; you kept adapting.</p><p>If you were gay, you spent much of your life hiding. The Stonewall Riots happened when you were twenty-three, but acceptance took decades. You might have lived a double life, married to someone of the opposite sex while loving someone else. You might have come out late, or never. The freedom your grandchildren take for granted was earned by people who suffered for it—including, perhaps, you.</p><p>Your friendships have endured across distance and decades. The people you knew in high school, in college, in your first job—some of those relationships have lasted sixty years. You write actual letters, or you did before email. You call on the phone, voice to voice, not just text. You've learned to FaceTime with grandchildren, even if someone has to help you set it up. Connection has always mattered to you. The technology changed; the need didn't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>You worked hard. That's true. You showed up, paid your dues, climbed the ladder, built careers over decades. What's harder to see is how much the ladder itself helped—a ladder that extended down to meet you and has since been pulled up, rung by rung, for those who came after.</p><p>The math is invisible to you because it worked in your favor. You see younger generations struggle with milestones you achieved easily and assume the difference is effort. But the economic terrain changed after you crossed it. The housing market, the job market, the cost of education—all transformed while your assumptions stayed fixed.</p><p>You've confused your circumstances with your character. 'We didn't have handouts' ignores the GI Bill, the highway system, the subsidized suburbs, the corporate pensions, the union wages, the Medicare and Social Security you now collect. These were handouts—just not called that. The bootstraps you pulled yourself up by were government-issued.</p><p>Your political memories are selective. You remember protesting Vietnam but forget that more of your generation supported the war than opposed it. You remember the counterculture but forget you mostly lived in the culture. The radical Boomers made the news; the conservative Boomers made the majority. Both were you.</p><p>Climate change is your generation's blind spot made physical. You've lived through the entire arc of the crisis—from early warnings in the 1970s to increasingly desperate alarms today—and your collective response has been inadequate to the scale of the threat. You'll die before the worst consequences arrive. Your grandchildren won't.</p><p>The hardest blind spot to see is the one about power. You've held it for so long—political power, economic power, cultural power—that sharing it feels like losing it. The world is waiting for you to step aside, and stepping aside feels like death. It isn't. But it feels that way, which is why it's so hard.</p>"

You're the original, the first wave, the template everyone else gets measured against.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They followed the rules you questioned. They married for life, worked one job, trusted institutions. They were children during the Depression and teenagers during the war; you were children during abundance and teenagers during transformation. They built the world you inherited. They're mostly gone now. You're next.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Your younger siblings, your oldest children. They grew up in your shadow, which annoyed them. Latchkey kids while you were at work. They came of age during economic uncertainty—the 1970s stagflation, the 1980s recessions. They're skeptical where you were optimistic, ironic where you were earnest. They've spent their whole lives waiting for you to retire so they can have a turn. They're still waiting.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> Your children and grandchildren. They graduated into the Great Recession, the 2008 crash, a job market that had no room for them. They're the most educated generation in history, and they can't afford houses. They blame you for pulling up the ladder. You think they're entitled. Both sides have a point. Neither is entirely wrong.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Your grandchildren, mostly. They've never known a world without smartphones, without school shootings, without the constant hum of climate anxiety. They have worse mental health outcomes than any generation on record—not because they're weaker, but because the world is harder. They look at you like you're from another planet. You are.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 66 years for men, 71 for women. You've beaten those odds—if you were born in 1946 and you're reading this, you're in your late seventies. You've lived through more technological, social, and political change than any generation in history. You were born into the world of radio and grew old in the world of AI. You've seen everything. You've done most of it. The question now is what you'll leave behind.</p>"
