      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born in the first year of the Baby Boom, when returning GIs came home from World War II and got to work building families. Your birth certificate might as well say 'American Optimism' under birthplace. The war was over. America won. The future was wide open.</p><p>Your childhood was suburban if your family could afford it, urban if they couldn't, rural if they'd never left. Levittown was being built. The Interstate Highway System was just getting started. America was constructing the infrastructure that would define the next century, and you were along for the ride in the back of a station wagon.</p><p>Television arrived during your childhood—black and white, three channels, everyone watching the same thing at the same time. Howdy Doody. I Love Lucy. The Mickey Mouse Club. Your family probably didn't have a TV at first; then suddenly everyone did. It happened that fast.</p><p>You grew up in the shadow of the bomb. Duck and cover drills at school. Backyard fallout shelters. The Cold War was the background hum of your childhood—the sense that everything could end at any moment, which made the present feel both precious and fragile.</p><p>The Korean War happened while you were in elementary school. McCarthyism. The Rosenberg executions. The adults seemed scared of things you didn't quite understand—communists, spies, subversives. You learned early that fear could be weaponized.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year The Best Years of Our Lives won Best Picture—a movie about soldiers adjusting to postwar life that your parents probably related to more than you ever could. Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life came out that Christmas, though it wouldn't become a classic until decades later.</p><p>Music in 1946 was big bands and crooners. Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra. The Andrews Sisters. Rock and roll didn't exist yet—that was coming, and you'd be the first teenagers to hear it. But in 1946, swing was still king and your parents were dancing to it.</p><p>Your childhood TV was variety shows and westerns. Ed Sullivan. Gunsmoke. The Lone Ranger. Television was a window into a carefully curated version of America—whiter, cleaner, and more wholesome than the actual country outside your window.</p><p>Elvis happened when you were ten. That was the dividing line—before Elvis and after. Your parents were horrified. You were electrified. Rock and roll wasn't just music; it was a declaration of independence from everything your parents thought they knew about the world.</p><p>By high school, you had Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Chuck Berry. Movies had James Dean and Marilyn Monroe. Culture was fragmenting along generational lines in ways that hadn't happened before. You were teenagers at the exact moment teenagers became a market demographic, a cultural force, a thing unto themselves.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born before the transistor. The first computers filled entire rooms and had less processing power than a modern calculator. Technology in 1946 meant rotary phones, typewriters, and radios. The future was promised but not yet delivered.</p><p>Television transformed your childhood, but it was still a novelty when you started school. By the time you finished high school, it was the center of American life. You watched that transformation happen—from radio families gathered around speakers to TV families gathered around screens.</p><p>The Space Race defined your young adulthood. You were eleven when Sputnik launched. Thirteen when NASA was founded. Twenty-three when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. You literally watched humanity reach for the stars, and for a moment, it seemed like anything was possible.</p><p>Computers remained room-sized mainframes through your entire career. You didn't have email until late in life, if ever. The internet happened after you retired. Your technological journey was from vacuum tubes to smartphones—the longest technological arc any generation has lived through.</p><p>You've adapted more than any generation in history. Born before antibiotics were common, you now carry a device in your pocket with more computing power than the Apollo missions. That's not nothing. That's extraordinary. Even if the grandkids have to show you how to use it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three when the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb, officially starting the nuclear arms race that would define your entire life. The relative safety of American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted exactly four years after Hiroshima.</p><p>You were four when North Korea invaded South Korea, beginning a war that would kill 36,000 Americans and leave the peninsula divided to this day. Korea was the first war of the Cold War era—the template for Vietnam, Afghanistan, and every proxy conflict that followed.</p><p>You were seven when the Korean War ended in stalemate. Eight when Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation unconstitutional. Nine when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. The civil rights movement was gathering force while you were learning long division.</p><p>You were seventeen when JFK was inaugurated. Eighteen when the Bay of Pigs failed. Nineteen when the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. You were young enough to be drafted and old enough to understand what that meant.</p><p>You were twenty-two when the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam. You were draft-eligible during the worst years of the war. Whether you went, dodged, or stayed home, Vietnam shaped your generation like nothing since World War II shaped your parents.</p><p>You were thirty-two when Watergate forced Nixon's resignation. Thirty-seven during the Iran hostage crisis. Forty-five when the Berlin Wall fell. Fifty-five during 9/11. Sixty-two during the 2008 crash. Seventy-four during COVID. History never stopped happening, and you were there for all of it.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around {{WORKFORCE_ENTRY_YEAR}}, when the American economy was the undisputed engine of the world. Europe and Japan were still rebuilding. American manufacturing had no real competition. A high school diploma could get you a job that supported a family. That was just how it worked.</p><p>Company loyalty was a two-way street. You joined a firm expecting to stay for decades, and firms expected to keep you. Pensions were standard. Health insurance was assumed. The social contract between employer and employee was real, and both sides mostly honored it.</p><p>You probably had the same job, or at least the same employer, for most of your career. Job-hopping wasn't a strategy; it was a red flag. Your resume told a story of steady advancement, not lateral moves and reinventions. Stability was the goal, and it was achievable.</p><p>Women in your generation entered the workforce in unprecedented numbers, but at a significant disadvantage. The women's movement opened doors your mothers never had, but equal pay and equal respect were still decades away. Progress happened, but slowly.</p><p>You likely retired with a pension—one of the last generations to do so. The 401(k) replaced defined-benefit plans during your career, but if you were lucky, you had both. You retired into a Social Security system that still works, at least for now, at least for you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were raised by Depression survivors. Your parents remembered bread lines, bank failures, and the complete collapse of the American economy. That shaped how they raised you—frugal, careful, suspicious of debt. Save for a rainy day. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Cash is king.</p><p>But you also lived through the greatest economic expansion in American history. The postwar boom turned thrift into prosperity. Houses were cheap. Jobs were plentiful. The stock market went up. Your parents' caution made sense in the 1930s; your optimism made sense in the 1950s.</p><p>You bought your first house when houses cost a fraction of what they cost now. A median home in the 1960s was about twice the median annual income. You built equity almost accidentally, simply by owning property during decades of appreciation. That wealth compounded.</p><p>The 1970s stagflation was your first real economic shock—inflation, unemployment, gas lines. But you were established enough to weather it. The 1987 crash was scary but brief. The 2008 crisis hit your retirement savings, but you had Social Security as a backstop.</p><p>Your financial psychology is shaped by scarcity you experienced through your parents and abundance you experienced directly. You're cautious but comfortable. You've accumulated wealth that your children need and your grandchildren are counting on. Whether and how that wealth transfers will shape American inequality for generations.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You came of age during the cultural revolution. JFK, Beatles, Vietnam, civil rights—your twenties were a firehose of history. You either went to Vietnam, protested it, or tried not to think about it. You married younger than any generation since. You had kids before you fully understood what adulthood meant.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> You settled into careers and mortgages while the country seemed to lose its mind. Watergate. Energy crisis. Stagflation. The optimism of your childhood gave way to a more complicated reality. You were building families while the institutions you trusted were revealing themselves as fallible.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> Reagan and recovery. The economy roared back. Your careers peaked. Your kids grew up. You were the establishment now, for better or worse. The yuppie era celebrated your success even as it caricatured your values. You'd made it—now what?</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> The Cold War ended. The internet arrived. Your kids left home. You started thinking about retirement while still years away from it. The world you'd known was transforming, and you weren't sure you recognized what it was becoming.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_PLUS}}+):</strong> You've retired into a world unrecognizable from the one you were born into. 9/11 happened. The 2008 crash happened. COVID happened. You've watched your grandchildren grow up in a digital world that didn't exist when you were raising your own children. You're the last connection to a mid-century America that increasingly feels like a foreign country. Your memories are history now.</p>"
