      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1946-1958</h2><p>The smell of this cohort's mother's Victory Garden, not quite abandoned yet. Spam sandwiches on Wonder Bread. The crackle of the Philco radio in the living room, this cohort's whole family gathered around it like a campfire. This cohort's childhood had a sound—the hiss and pop of AM broadcasts, the tinny theme songs of The Shadow and Fibber McGee and Molly drifting through screen doors on summer evenings.</p><p>At five, this cohort was playing with Lincoln Logs, building frontier cabins on the living room floor while this cohort's father read the newspaper in his armchair. Tinker Toys for the mechanically minded. Erector Sets if this cohort's family had the money. This cohort's Radio Flyer wagon was this cohort's vehicle of choice—hauling rocks, giving rides to the neighbor kids, racing down hills with no regard for safety because safety wasn't invented yet.</p><p>This cohort were six when I Love Lucy premiered, and suddenly every household wanted a television set. This cohort's family might have been the first on the block, or this cohort might have crowded into the neighbor's living room every Tuesday night. Howdy Doody was on at 5:30, Kukla, Fran and Ollie before dinner. The test pattern at night, that Indian head staring back at this cohort, meant the world had gone to bed.</p><p>This cohort's toys were physical, imaginative, slightly dangerous. Cap guns that actually sparked. Chemistry sets with real chemicals. BB guns at eight if this cohort's father thought this cohort was ready. This cohort played outside until the streetlights came on—no supervision, no schedule, just the freedom of a generation whose parents were too relieved the war was over to hover.</p><p>At seven, this cohort did duck-and-cover drills at school, hiding under this cohort's wooden desk as if it could protect this cohort from atomic fire. The teacher didn't explain why. The filmstrip showed a cartoon turtle. This cohort learned to live with existential dread before this cohort learned long division. The bomb was always there, humming beneath the optimism like a basement furnace that might explode.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>The year this cohort was born, Bing Crosby was everywhere—his voice coming out of every radio, every jukebox, every department store speaker. 'White Christmas' was already a classic. The Andrews Sisters harmonized on 'Rum and Coca-Cola.' Perry Como crooned. Big bands were still swinging, but the war that made them essential was over. The music was about to change.</p><p>This cohort's actual pop culture awakening started with radio serials. The Lone Ranger at 7:30, that 'Hi-yo, Silver!' sending this cohort galloping around the backyard. The Shadow, whose power to cloud men's minds seemed genuinely plausible at five years old. Superman on the radio—this cohort believed a man could fly before this cohort ever saw it.</p><p>At six, television arrived like a spaceship in this cohort's living room. Milton Berle on Tuesday nights—'Mr. Television' himself—and this cohort's whole neighborhood crowded around whoever had a set. Arthur Godfrey. Sid Caesar. The Texaco Star Theatre. By eight, this cohort was watching Dragnet, memorizing 'Just the facts, ma'am.' By ten, Davy Crockett had every kid in America wearing a coonskin cap. This cohort probably had one. This cohort definitely wanted one.</p><p>Then Elvis. This cohort were ten years old in 1956 when he appeared on Ed Sullivan, shot only from the waist up because his hips were too dangerous for America. This cohort's parents were horrified. This cohort were transformed. 'Heartbreak Hotel,' 'Hound Dog,' 'Don't Be Cruel'—this wasn't this cohort's parents' music. This was theirs. Rock and roll drew a line between generations, and this cohort was on the right side of it.</p><p>By high school, Chuck Berry was doing his duck walk, Little Richard was screaming 'Tutti Frutti,' and Buddy Holly was making music that wouldn't sound dated sixty years later. James Dean died at twenty-four, becoming immortal. Marilyn Monroe was on every magazine cover. This cohort were teenagers at the exact moment teenager became a market category, a cultural identity, a force that adults feared and advertisers courted.</p><p>At seventeen, West Side Story was on Broadway. The Twilight Zone premiered. Motown started in Detroit. The Fifties were ending, and the Sixties were about to arrive with everything they'd bring—but this cohort'd be there for all of it, young enough to dance and old enough to understand what was happening.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>This cohort's Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year this cohort was born, ENIAC—the first general-purpose computer—was unveiled at the University of Pennsylvania. It weighed thirty tons, filled a room, and could do math faster than any human. This cohort wouldn't touch a computer for another forty years. Technology in 1946 meant rotary phones with party lines, where Mrs. Henderson down the street could listen to this cohort's conversations. It meant typewriters and carbon paper. It meant radio—the internet of this cohort's childhood, connecting this cohort to the world beyond this cohort's neighborhood.</p><p>At eight, this cohort's family might have gotten their first television—a Philco or RCA with a screen the size of a dinner plate, furniture built around it like a shrine. Reception was terrible. Rabbit ears needed constant adjustment. The picture rolled. None of that mattered. This cohort were watching moving pictures in this cohort's living room. It was magic.</p><p>At eleven, this cohort watched history from the couch. October 4, 1957: Sputnik. The Soviets put a satellite in space while this cohort was doing homework. The beep-beep-beep signal they broadcast was picked up by ham radio operators across America. This cohort's parents were terrified. This cohort were fascinated. Space wasn't science fiction anymore.</p><p>At twelve, NASA was founded. At thirteen, this cohort watched the Mercury Seven become celebrities. At seventeen, John Glenn orbited the Earth three times, and this cohort's entire school gathered around televisions to watch the recovery. At twenty-three, this cohort saw Neil Armstrong step onto the moon—live, in this cohort's living room, with 600 million other people. 'One small step for man.' This cohort were there. This cohort remember exactly where this cohort was sitting.</p><p>The technological arc of this cohort's life is unprecedented in human history. Born before penicillin was widely available, before polio vaccines, before transistors. This cohort learned to type on manual typewriters, calculated with slide rules, researched in card catalogs. This cohort got this cohort's first color TV around thirty. This cohort's first microwave around forty. This cohort's first personal computer, if this cohort got one at all, in this cohort's fifties or sixties. Email after retirement. Smartphones in this cohort's seventies.</p><p>This cohort've watched technology go from vacuum tubes to quantum computing, from party lines to video calls with grandchildren on the other side of the planet. This cohort learned to adapt because the alternative was being left behind. The grandkids might have to show this cohort how to use the iPad, but this cohort watched humanity land on the moon. This cohort saw the future arrive. This cohort're still seeing it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were this cohort when this cohort learned the Soviets had the bomb? This cohort were three, probably too young to understand, but this cohort felt it—the shift in the adults around this cohort, the way conversations stopped when this cohort entered the room. August 1949. The American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted exactly four years. The arms race that would define this cohort's entire life had begun.</p><p>At four, North Korea invaded South Korea. This cohort's father's friends, the same men who'd just come home from World War II, were being called up again. Korea was the first war of the Cold War—a template for conflicts that would stretch across decades. Thirty-six thousand Americans died. The peninsula remains divided today.</p><p>At seven, the Korean War ended in stalemate. At eight, Brown v. Board of Education declared segregated schools unconstitutional—though this cohort might not have noticed, depending on where this cohort lived. At nine, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, and something shifted in the country. At ten, the Little Rock Nine integrated Central High School while the National Guard stood watch. This cohort were learning to see this cohort's country more clearly.</p><p>At eleven, Sputnik crossed the sky. America was behind. This cohort's teachers started emphasizing math and science like national security depended on it—because it did. At twelve, NASA was founded. At thirteen, Fidel Castro took Cuba. The Cold War had come to the Caribbean.</p><p>At fourteen, John F. Kennedy was inaugurated. 'Ask not what your country can do for you.' This cohort believed it. At fifteen, the Bay of Pigs failed. At sixteen, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the edge of nuclear war—thirteen days in October when everything this cohort knew might have ended. This cohort remember the fear. This cohort remember waiting.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At seventeen, Kennedy was assassinated. November 22, 1963. This cohort remember where this cohort was. Everyone this cohort's age does.</span> The principal's voice over the intercom, or the teacher crying, or the television in the store window. Something broke that day. The optimism of this cohort's childhood cracked, and it never fully healed.</p><p>At eighteen, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution escalated Vietnam. At nineteen, this cohort was draft-eligible. Some of this cohort went—55,000 names eventually carved into black granite. Some protested. Some dodged. All of this cohort was shaped by it. Vietnam was this cohort's generation's defining wound, a war that divided families and destroyed faith in institutions.</p><p>At twenty-three, this cohort watched Apollo 11 land on the moon. For one moment, the country unified. Then back to earth: at twenty-eight, Watergate. At thirty-three, Saigon fell. At thirty-seven, the Iran hostage crisis. At forty, Reagan was shot. At forty-five, the Berlin Wall fell—the Cold War this cohort'd lived under this cohort's entire adult life suddenly, impossibly over. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At sixty-two, the financial crash. At seventy-four, COVID-19. History kept happening. This cohort kept watching. This cohort're still watching.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>This cohort entered the workforce around 1964 or 1968, depending on whether this cohort went to college. Either way, this cohort walked into the greatest economic expansion in human history. Europe and Japan were still rebuilding from rubble. American manufacturing had no real competition. A high school diploma could get this cohort a job at the plant that would support a family of four, a house, a car, and a vacation every summer. A college degree made this cohort management material. The American Dream wasn't a slogan—it was a business plan that actually worked.</p><p>The social contract between employer and employee was real. This cohort joined a company expecting to stay for decades; the company expected to keep this cohort. IBM. General Motors. AT&T. U.S. Steel. These weren't just employers—they were institutions that provided identity, community, health insurance, and a pension. This cohort gave them this cohort's loyalty; they gave this cohort a gold watch and a retirement this cohort could count on.</p><p>This cohort's resume probably shows one employer, maybe two or three. Job-hopping wasn't a career strategy—it was a character flaw. This cohort climbed the ladder: assistant, associate, manager, director. Each rung meant more money, more responsibility, more security. The rules were clear. Follow them, work hard, and this cohort'd be taken care of. Most of this cohort was.</p><p>If this cohort was a woman, the rules were different. This cohort could be a teacher, a nurse, a secretary—careers that were respected but underpaid, essential but undervalued. The women's movement opened doors in the 1970s, but this cohort'd already made this cohort's choices by then. Some of this cohort broke through anyway. Most accommodated a system that limited this cohort's options while praising this cohort's contributions. The women's work that kept households running was never counted in GDP.</p><p>If this cohort was a man, the deal was straightforward: provide. Work defined this cohort. This cohort's job was this cohort's identity. Retirement at sixty-five was a reward earned through decades of showing up, and the pension made it possible to actually stop. This cohort're one of the last generations for whom that arithmetic worked—defined-benefit plans, Social Security that paid out more than this cohort put in, home equity that multiplied while this cohort slept.</p><p>The 401(k) was invented in 1978, when this cohort was thirty-two. It was supposed to supplement pensions, not replace them. But this cohort probably got both. The generations that followed got spreadsheets and hope. The social contract this cohort worked under was shredded after this cohort left the workforce—but it held long enough for this cohort.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>This cohort's parents remembered everything. Bread lines. Bank failures. Soup kitchens. The neighbor who lost the farm. The relative who never recovered. The Depression didn't just shape their finances—it shaped their souls, and they passed that down to this cohort. Save for a rainy day. Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without. Never throw away string. Never waste food. Money in the mattress is money this cohort can trust.</p><p>But this cohort also lived through the greatest economic expansion in human history. This cohort's parents' caution met postwar abundance, and the combination made this cohort wealthy almost by accident. Houses cost twice the median income in the 1960s—not six times, like today. This cohort bought this cohort's first home for $15,000, maybe $25,000, on a single salary with a reasonable mortgage. That house is now worth $400,000, $600,000, a million depending on where this cohort bought. This cohort didn't do anything special. This cohort just bought property when property was affordable and held it while it appreciated.</p><p>The math tells the story—and the comparison section lays it out in detail. This cohort're not richer because this cohort worked harder. This cohort're richer because this cohort was born into an economy that worked. Rising tides lifted this cohort's boat. Then the tides stopped rising.</p><p>The 1970s gave this cohort stagflation—inflation over 10%, gas lines, the sense that the postwar party was over. But this cohort was established. This cohort had equity. This cohort weathered it. The 1987 crash was terrifying for forty-eight hours, then recovered. The 2008 crisis hit this cohort's retirement accounts, but Social Security held, this cohort's pension (if this cohort had one) held, and this cohort's house—this cohort's house just kept appreciating.</p><p>This cohort's financial psychology is a contradiction this cohort've learned to live with. The scarcity mindset from this cohort's parents. The abundance reality from this cohort's own experience. This cohort clip coupons and own three properties. This cohort worry about Social Security while collecting more than this cohort contributed. This cohort tell this cohort's grandchildren to work hard and save, not quite understanding that the equation this cohort solved no longer balances for them.</p><p>The wealth this cohort've accumulated will shape American inequality for generations. Whether this cohort give it to this cohort's children, leave it to this cohort's grandchildren, spend it on cruises, or donate it to charity—these decisions matter more than this cohort might realize. This cohort're the richest generation in American history, sitting on the largest intergenerational wealth transfer ever. What happens next is partly up to this cohort.</p>"

Assassinations—JFK when this cohort was seventeen, then MLK and RFK when this cohort was twenty-two. The Summer of Love. Woodstock. The Moon landing. Nixon. Watergate. This cohort married younger than any generation since—median age of twenty-one for women, twenty-three for men. This cohort had kids before this cohort fully understood what adulthood meant, because that's what this cohort did. The script was clear even as the world around this cohort burned.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 30s (1976-1986):</strong> This cohort settled into careers and mortgages while America seemed to lose its way. Stagflation. Gas lines. The Iran hostage crisis. Disco died. Reagan was elected. This cohort were building families, coaching Little League, attending PTA meetings while the institutions this cohort'd trusted—the presidency, the church, the company—revealed themselves as fallible. The Bicentennial came and went. This cohort's kids discovered MTV. This cohort bought a VCR and wondered what the world was coming to.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 40s (1986-1996):</strong> Peak earning years. Peak responsibility. This cohort's careers crested. This cohort's kids became teenagers with their own problems, their own music, their own incomprehensible slang. The Berlin Wall fell when this cohort was forty-three—the Cold War this cohort'd lived under this cohort's entire adult life just... ended. The Soviet Union collapsed. History was supposed to be over. This cohort started thinking about retirement, even if it felt decades away. The internet arrived, though this cohort weren't sure what it was for.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 50s (1996-2006):</strong> This cohort's kids left home. This cohort's parents needed help. This cohort were sandwiched between generations, managing up and down simultaneously. Some of this cohort divorced. Some reinvented themselves. Some doubled down on the life this cohort'd built. September 11, 2001: this cohort was fifty-five, watching the towers fall, understanding instantly that the world had changed again. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The housing bubble inflating. This cohort started thinking seriously about when, not if, to retire.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 60s and 70s (2006-2026):</strong> The 2008 crash hit this cohort's retirement accounts, but this cohort's house held value, this cohort's Social Security arrived on schedule, and this cohort had options this cohort's children don't. This cohort retired into a world unrecognizable from the one this cohort was born into. Smartphones. Social media. Grandchildren who never knew a world without the internet. COVID-19 at seventy-four—a pandemic that hit this cohort's generation hardest, that forced isolation and fear and a reckoning with mortality. This cohort're in this cohort's late seventies now, the oldest surviving Boomers, carrying memories of mid-century America that fewer people each year can verify. This cohort remember radio dramas, rotary phones, segregated water fountains, the day Kennedy died. This cohort're living history. Soon, this cohort'll be history.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The name came from the birth surge that started the year this generation was born—1946, when the GIs came home and America started making families like it was a national project. Boomers're the original Boomer, the very first year of the cohort, born into a country that had just saved the world and was ready to enjoy the spoils.</p><p>There are <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> of this generation, give or take. The largest generation in American history until Millennials edged past in raw numbers. But this generation've controlled more wealth, more political power, and more cultural real estate than any generation before or since. Every president from Clinton through Biden has been a Boomer. Boomers've run the country for thirty years. Boomers're still running it.</p><p>This generation's generation spans 1946 to 1964—a massive cohort with internal divisions as sharp as any generational gap. Boomers're a 'first-wave' Boomer, born in the immediate postwar surge. Boomers were already a teenager when the youngest Boomers were born. Boomers went to Woodstock; they went to disco. Boomers protested Vietnam; they don't remember it. The Boomer label covers multitudes, but this generation're the prototype.</p><p>Boomers were the first mass youth culture. Before this generation, 'teenager' wasn't really a category. Boomers invented it—or at least, marketers invented it to sell to this generation. Rock and roll was this generation's music. Blue jeans were this generation's uniform. Rebellion was this generation's brand, even when the rebellion was mostly aesthetic. Boomers believed this generation could change the world. For a moment, it looked like this generation might.</p><p>The Sixties defined this generation. Civil rights, the sexual revolution, Vietnam, the counterculture—this generation was young enough to participate and old enough to understand. Some of this generation marched on Washington. Some of this generation went to Vietnam. Some of this generation did both. The culture wars that still divide America started in this generation's living rooms, at this generation's dinner tables, between this generation and this generation's parents.</p><p>Then this generation grew up. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The hippies became stockbrokers. The activists became executives. The revolution was televised, monetized, and eventually abandoned.</span> Boomers're now accused of selling out everything this generation once stood for—taking the ladders this generation climbed and pulling them up behind this generation. That's not entirely fair. It's not entirely unfair either.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when courting meant asking permission to call? When her father answered the phone and this generation had to make conversation before she'd come on the line? When a date meant picking her up at the door, shaking hands with her parents, promising to have her home by ten? The rules were strict, elaborate, and everyone knew them.</p><p>Boomers married young by today's standards—twenty-one for women, twenty-three for men on average. The sexual revolution was coming, but this generation was probably engaged before it arrived, or married shortly after. The Pill changed everything, but slowly. This generation's older siblings followed the old rules. This generation's younger ones broke them. Boomers was somewhere in the transition.</p><p>Divorce was shameful when this generation got married; it was common by the time this generation's own kids were teenagers. This generation's generation normalized ending unhappy marriages—for better and worse. Some of this generation stayed in marriages that suffocated this generation because that's what people did. Some of this generation divorced and started over, sometimes more than once. The stigma faded. The pain didn't.</p><p>Boomers've had to learn new languages of intimacy. This generation's children wanted to 'process feelings' and 'communicate openly'—therapy-speak that sounded like a foreign language. This generation's grandchildren date through apps this generation've never heard of, following rules that seem like no rules at all. Gender roles this generation thought were eternal turned out to be historical. The world kept changing; this generation kept adapting.</p><p>If this generation was gay, this generation spent much of this generation's life hiding. The Stonewall Riots happened when this generation was twenty-three, but acceptance took decades. Boomers might have lived a double life, married to someone of the opposite sex while loving someone else. Boomers might have come out late, or never. The freedom this generation's grandchildren take for granted was earned by people who suffered for it—including, perhaps, this generation.</p><p>This generation's friendships have endured across distance and decades. The people this generation knew in high school, in college, in this generation's first job—some of those relationships have lasted sixty years. Boomers write actual letters, or this generation did before email. Boomers call on the phone, voice to voice, not just text. Boomers've learned to FaceTime with grandchildren, even if someone has to help this generation set it up. Connection has always mattered to this generation. The technology changed; the need didn't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>This generation's Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Boomers worked hard. That's true. Boomers showed up, paid this generation's dues, climbed the ladder, built careers over decades. What's harder to see is how much the ladder itself helped—a ladder that extended down to meet this generation and has since been pulled up, rung by rung, for those who came after.</p><p>The math is invisible to this generation because it worked in this generation's favor. Boomers see younger generations struggle with milestones this generation achieved easily and assume the difference is effort. But the economic terrain changed after this generation crossed it. The housing market, the job market, the cost of education—all transformed while this generation's assumptions stayed fixed.</p><p>Boomers've confused this generation's circumstances with this generation's character. 'We didn't have handouts' ignores the GI Bill, the highway system, the subsidized suburbs, the corporate pensions, the union wages, the Medicare and Social Security this generation now collect. These were handouts—just not called that. The bootstraps this generation pulled themselves up by were government-issued.</p><p>This generation's political memories are selective. Boomers remember protesting Vietnam but forget that more of this generation's generation supported the war than opposed it. Boomers remember the counterculture but forget this generation mostly lived in the culture. The radical Boomers made the news; the conservative Boomers made the majority. Both were this generation.</p><p>Climate change is this generation's generation's blind spot made physical. Boomers've lived through the entire arc of the crisis—from early warnings in the 1970s to increasingly desperate alarms today—and this generation's collective response has been inadequate to the scale of the threat. Boomers'll die before the worst consequences arrive. This generation's grandchildren won't.</p><p>The hardest blind spot to see is the one about power. Boomers've held it for so long—political power, economic power, cultural power—that sharing it feels like losing it. The world is waiting for this generation to step aside, and stepping aside feels like death. It isn't. But it feels that way, which is why it's so hard.</p>"

Boomers're the original, the first wave, the template everyone else gets measured against.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They followed the rules this generation questioned. They married for life, worked one job, trusted institutions. They were children during the Depression and teenagers during the war; this generation was children during abundance and teenagers during transformation. They built the world this generation inherited. They're mostly gone now. Boomers're next.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> This generation's younger siblings, this generation's oldest children. They grew up in this generation's shadow, which annoyed them. Latchkey kids while this generation was at work. They came of age during economic uncertainty—the 1970s stagflation, the 1980s recessions. They're skeptical where this generation was optimistic, ironic where this generation was earnest. They've spent their whole lives waiting for this generation to retire so they can have a turn. They're still waiting.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> This generation's children and grandchildren. They graduated into the Great Recession, the 2008 crash, a job market that had no room for them. They're the most educated generation in history, and they can't afford houses. They blame this generation for pulling up the ladder. Boomers think they're entitled. Both sides have a point. Neither is entirely wrong.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> This generation's grandchildren, mostly. They've never known a world without smartphones, without school shootings, without the constant hum of climate anxiety. They have worse mental health outcomes than any generation on record—not because they're weaker, but because the world is harder. They look at this generation like this generation're from another planet. Boomers are.</p><p>This generation's life expectancy at birth was about 66 years for men, 71 for women. Boomers've beaten those odds—if this generation was born in 1946 and this generation're reading this, this generation're in this generation's late seventies. Boomers've lived through more technological, social, and political change than any generation in history. Boomers were born into the world of radio and grew old in the world of AI.
