      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1971-1983</h2><p>The smell of Shake 'n Bake coating chicken on a Wednesday night. The crinkle of opening a new pack of Wacky Packages stickers. The weight of a View-Master pressed against your face, clicking through Grand Canyon slides you'd never actually visit. Your childhood had a specific sensory texture—avocado appliances, shag carpet under bare feet, wood-paneled station wagons with no seatbelts in the back.</p><p>At four, you were watching Sesame Street when it still had a genuine New York edge—Oscar wasn't just grouchy, he was urban grouchy. By five, you'd graduated to The Electric Company, learning to read from Rita Moreno shouting 'HEY YOU GUYS!' You probably had strong opinions about whether Easy Reader or Fargo North, Decoder was cooler. (It was Easy Reader. Morgan Freeman before anyone knew he was Morgan Freeman.)</p><p>Your toys defined you. Hot Wheels tracks snaking down the hallway. Big Wheel races around the cul-de-sac, that satisfying plastic-on-concrete sound. Weebles wobbled but didn't fall down—the first lesson in resilience marketed to children. Evel Knievel stunt cycles launched across the kitchen floor. Lite-Brite pictures made in the dark, the heat of those tiny bulbs against your fingers.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred. You woke before your parents, poured yourself a bowl of Quisp or Freakies, and planted yourself in front of the TV. Scooby-Doo, Speed Buggy, Hong Kong Phooey—hours of animated nonsense interrupted only by cereal commercials and PSAs about not putting beans in your ears. You controlled this time. The adults were sleeping. The world was yours.</p><p>You ate Hamburger Helper (new in '71, the year you were born), tuna casserole with crushed potato chips on top, and TV dinners in their aluminum trays. You drank Tang because the astronauts drank it, and Kool-Aid because it was five cents a packet. You begged for Count Chocula and settled for Cheerios. You learned early that what you wanted and what you got were different things.</p><p>At six, Star Wars rewired your brain. You were Luke's age—maybe a little younger—and suddenly every stick was a lightsaber, every cardboard box was an X-wing cockpit, every vacant lot was Tatooine. You wanted the action figures for Christmas and maybe got two, because they cost $2.49 each and your parents had three kids. You made do. Imagination filled the gaps.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Gen X</h2><p>Gen X. The slacker generation. The MTV generation. The whatever generation. The label started as an insult—Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel named you after the variable 'X,' the unknown, the undefined. Boomers couldn't categorize you, so they called you apathetic. They mistook self-reliance for indifference. They still do.</p><p>Your generation spans 1965 to 1980—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Americans, sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials. The middle child of American generations: overlooked, underfunded, expected to figure it out yourself. And you did. Not because you were special, but because nobody was watching.</p><p>The latchkey kid wasn't a lifestyle choice—it was economic necessity. Your mom went back to work. Your parents divorced (half of them, anyway). You came home to an empty house, made yourself a snack, did your homework, and watched too much television. You learned that adults weren't always available, that help wasn't always coming, that self-sufficiency was survival. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span> These lessons served you well. They also left scars.</p><p>Your defining moment came at fifteen: the Challenger exploded on live television. January 28, 1986. Christa McAuliffe, the teacher-astronaut, was supposed to make space accessible. Instead, you watched seven people die in seventy-three seconds. The O-ring failed. The institution failed. You learned that even NASA could be catastrophically wrong, that ambition could kill while everyone watched. Every classroom in America shared that trauma simultaneously—your generation's first collective wound.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> You're the skeptic generation. You don't trust corporations (you've been laid off). You don't trust government (you watched it fail). You don't trust institutions (they've earned your distrust). But you're not nihilists—you're pragmatists. You believe things can work; you just don't expect them to. <span class=\"hero-callout\">You can still entertain yourself without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>All in the Family premiered the year you were born—Archie Bunker screaming at Meathead while Edith warbled from the piano. America was yelling at itself, and Norman Lear turned it into primetime television. The French Connection won Best Picture. 'Joy to the World' by Three Dog Night made the whole country sing about Jeremiah the bullfrog. Carole King's Tapestry taught your parents that singer-songwriters could outsell rock bands.</p><p>Your actual pop culture education started in the back of a station wagon, listening to AM radio. 'Crocodile Rock' by Elton John. 'Bennie and the Jets.' The Eagles harmonizing about peaceful easy feelings while your parents argued in the front seat. Led Zeppelin on your older brother's stereo. James Taylor's voice like warm honey, even when you didn't understand what he was singing about.</p><p>At six, Star Wars demolished everything that came before. You saw it in the theater, probably multiple times. You collected the trading cards, memorized the dialogue, argued about whether Han shot first (he did). Close Encounters came the same year—Spielberg making aliens feel friendly while everything else in the world felt hostile. Your imagination was colonized by spaceships and lightsabers, and you didn't mind.</p><p>At ten, MTV launched, and music became visual. You saw 'Video Killed the Radio Star' first, then Michael Jackson moonwalking, then Madonna rolling around in a wedding dress. The images were more important than the songs, sometimes. You learned to judge music by how it looked, which was new. Pat Benatar, Duran Duran, A Flock of Seagulls with that ridiculous hair. You watched for hours because what else were you going to do?</p><p>By high school, John Hughes understood you better than your parents did. The Breakfast Club wasn't just a movie—it was testimony. Ferris Bueller spoke for every kid who'd figured out the system was absurd. Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful—Hughes made films about kids whose parents were absent, oblivious, or both. You recognized your own invisibility on screen, and it felt like validation.</p><p>College brought grunge, which finally gave your generation its sound: distortion and apathy, irony and pain. Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' in September '91 was year one of a new calendar. Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains—Seattle bands in flannel, singing about feeling alienated. You'd been feeling alienated for years. Nice to finally have a soundtrack.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The first microprocessor shipped the year you were born. Ray Tomlinson sent the first email. The world's first pocket calculator cost $395—nearly $3,000 in today's money—and could only add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Technology existed in 1971, but it was the size of refrigerators and cost more than cars. You'd witness its shrinking.</p><p>At six, the Atari 2600 arrived, and video games entered your living room. Pong was just bouncing a square—but it was bouncing a square you controlled. Combat. Space Invaders. Adventure, with that dragon that looked like a duck. The graphics were terrible and the magic was total. You'd spend hours in front of a TV, joystick in hand, while your parents wondered what was wrong with you.</p><p>At eleven, you probably encountered an Apple II in a school library or a friend's house. The cursor blinked green. You typed LOAD and waited for the cassette tape to screech. Oregon Trail taught you that dysentery was deadly and fording rivers was gambling. If you were lucky or nerdy, you learned BASIC—10 PRINT 'HELLO' / 20 GOTO 10—and felt like a wizard.</p><p>Your generation straddles the analog-digital divide more completely than any other. You remember typewriters with carbon paper. You remember card catalogs in libraries. You remember rotary phones, busy signals, phone books, and calling the time lady to set your watch. These aren't nostalgia—they're lived experience. You're fluent in a language that's nearly dead.</p><p>At thirteen, the IBM PC launched. At fourteen, the Macintosh made computers friendly. At twenty-two, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, and you didn't notice because nobody did. At twenty-four, Mosaic gave the web a face. By twenty-seven, everyone had email. The internet wasn't a revolution you watched—it was a tide that rose around you, year by year, until one day you were swimming in it.</p><p>Smartphones arrived when you were thirty-six, old enough to remember when phones were attached to walls and the internet was something you visited, not something that followed you everywhere. You adapted—your generation always does—but you know this is all optional. You remember offline. You remember boredom. You remember when reaching someone meant actually finding them, not just sending a text into the void.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At three, Nixon resigned.</span> You don't remember it—you were too young—but you grew up in its long shadow. Watergate taught America that presidents lie, and your generation absorbed that lesson before we could spell 'impeachment.' The cynicism wasn't learned; it was inherited.</p><p>At four, Saigon fell. Helicopters lifting off the embassy roof, people climbing fences, a war your parents' generation had protested finally ending in humiliation. You were too young to understand, but the images played on the evening news, and the mood in the house was something between relief and defeat. Vietnam wasn't your war, but it was your backdrop.</p><p>At eight, Three Mile Island nearly melted down. At nine, Iranian students took American hostages, and they stayed hostages for <span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days—the length of your fourth-grade year. At ten, John Lennon was shot outside his apartment. At eleven, Reagan was shot outside a hotel. Violence wasn't abstract. It was the evening news, every night, while you ate dinner.</p><p>At fifteen, the Challenger disaster became your generation's shared trauma—the shuttle broke apart while classrooms across America watched live.</p><p>At eighteen, the Berlin Wall fell. You watched Germans with sledgehammers, champagne, tears—the Cold War ending not with missiles but with masonry. The enemy you'd been raised to fear simply dissolved. At nineteen, Tiananmen Square: a man standing in front of tanks, and then nothing, because China controlled the story. Liberation and repression, broadcast simultaneously.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> You were at work, probably. Or commuting. Or just waking up. Someone said a plane hit the World Trade Center, and you thought small plane, accident. Then the second plane hit live on television, and the word 'accident' evaporated. You watched the towers fall. You watched people jumping. You called everyone you knew because cell networks were jammed and you needed to hear voices. The world before that morning—airports without security theater, wars with exit strategies, American invincibility—that world ended. You've lived in the after ever since.</p><p>At thirty-seven, the financial system collapsed. By then you had a mortgage, maybe kids, a 401(k) that was suddenly a 201(k). You watched banks fail, watched home values crater, watched your Boomer parents panic about retirement. For your generation, this was almost familiar. Systems fail. You'd been expecting it.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The rules changed while you were learning them. Here's what happened.</p><p>You entered the workforce around 1993, give or take. The early '90s recession was grinding down, but job markets were tight. 'Entry level' positions wanted two years of experience. You took what you could get—temp work, retail, something 'just for now' that lasted longer than planned. Your parents had joined companies at 22 and stayed for decades. You learned immediately that loyalty was a one-way street.</p><p>The corporate ladder your parents climbed was being dismantled while you stood at the bottom. Downsizing wasn't a crisis—it was a strategy. 'Right-sizing.' 'Restructuring.' 'Synergy.' The euphemisms multiplied, but the meaning was constant: you were expendable. Companies weren't families. They were machines that used people until they didn't. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span></p><p>You pioneered free-agent thinking because you had to. Your resume was always updated. Your network was always warm. You expected to be laid off—not if, when—and planned accordingly. Boomers called this disloyalty. You called it survival. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> The handshake deals that gave your parents pensions and security? They were already myths by the time you arrived.</p><p>The dot-com boom of the late '90s offered a detour. Suddenly, startups were hiring anyone who could spell 'HTML.' Stock options! Foosball tables! The future was going to be different. Then March 2000 arrived, the bubble popped, and you learned that new economies fail the same way old ones do. But you'd saved some money. You'd stayed skeptical. You survived because you never quite believed.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived.</span> You've watched Boomers refuse to retire, clogging the leadership pipeline for decades. You've watched Millennials get fast-tracked into positions you waited twenty years for. You went from 'too young to lead' to 'too old to understand' without ever getting your turn at the wheel. This is annoying. It's also on-brand—your generation never expected fairness, and you didn't get it.</p><p>Your work ethic is pragmatic, not performative. You'll put in the hours when they matter and refuse to fake it when they don't. You don't believe companies are families. You've seen too many families lay off half their members during a bad quarter. You work to live—a distinction Boomers found confusing and Millennials find aspirational.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember mix tapes? Hours spent with your finger hovering over the pause button, waiting for the radio to play the right song so you could capture it. The track list written in careful handwriting on the cassette's cardboard insert. This was how you told someone you liked them without having to say it—through song selection and sequencing and the courage to hand over the tape.</p><p>You dated the analog way. You met people at school, at work, at parties, at bars. You gave them your phone number on a piece of paper and hoped they'd call. When they called, they got your parents first, or your answering machine, or just endless ringing. The uncertainty was excruciating and also kind of romantic. You couldn't text 'u up?' at midnight. You had to mean it.</p><p>Your generation married later than your parents—average age around 26 or 27—but earlier than Millennials, who'd push it past 30. You probably got married in the mid-to-late '90s, when weddings still cost what a reasonable person could afford and houses were merely expensive rather than impossible. You didn't know how lucky you were. Timing is everything, and yours wasn't bad.</p><p>If you divorced—and about 40% of your generation did—you probably did it before your kids were grown. You watched your own parents' marriages collapse in the '70s and '80s (divorce rates peaked in 1981, when you were ten), and you swore you'd do better. Some of you did. Many of you learned that commitment is harder than it looks, especially when you were never shown how it worked.</p><p>Your communication style is the bridge. You can text, email, Slack, and Zoom, but you also remember when 'reach out' meant picking up a telephone that was attached to a wall. You find Gen Z's refusal to answer phone calls baffling. You find Boomers' refusal to text exhausting. You translate between worlds because someone has to.</p><p>Friendships are smaller circles now, deeper pools. You didn't have social media to maintain hundreds of shallow connections. You kept the people who mattered and let the rest drift away with changing area codes. This was healthy, though you didn't know to call it that. You learned that quantity isn't quality, that presence matters more than performance.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during your prime earning years.</span> The stagflation that ate your parents' savings in the '70s. The early '90s recession that greeted you at the workforce door. The dot-com collapse in 2000. The financial meltdown in 2008. You learned the economy's lessons through repetition: the floor can fall out, the safety net has holes, and nobody's coming to catch you. Mortgage rates hit <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span> in 1981. The market dropped <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span> in 2008.</p><p>Here's the math that shaped you. In 1975, when you were four, the median home cost about $33,000—roughly twice the median income. By 1995, when you were buying your first place, it was around $130,000—about 2.5 times income. Expensive, but manageable. By 2005, when Millennials started buying, it was $240,000—over four times income. You squeezed through before the door slammed shut. This was luck, not virtue.</p><p>You're probably the last generation that will retire with something resembling security. You entered the workforce when 401(k)s were new but still functioning, when employer matches existed, when compound interest had decades to work. You bought houses before they became fantasies. You paid for college before it required a mortgage. The American Dream wasn't dead when you reached for it. It was just dying.</p><p>Your financial psychology is defined by wary preparation. You save more than Millennials because you could, and invest more cautiously than Boomers because you've watched too many bubbles pop. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span> You're not optimistic about the economy—optimism is for people who haven't been paying attention. But you're not despairing either. You're hedged. Belt and suspenders. Cash in the mattress and index funds in the 401(k).</p><p>The sandwich generation pressure is real. Your parents are aging—needing more care, more help, more time. Your kids are adults struggling in an economy that's worse than yours was. You're simultaneously funding your own retirement, your parents' eldercare, and your children's emergency loans. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span> The math doesn't quite work, but it has to, so you make it.</p><p>You know you're luckier than the generations behind you. This knowledge doesn't make you feel good—it makes you feel complicit. You bought when buying was possible. You saved when saving was possible. The system worked just long enough to let you in, then changed the locks. You didn't design the system. But you benefited from it, and that sits uneasily.</p>"
    },
    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your skepticism was earned. But earned things can overstay their welcome. You learned to distrust institutions—a reasonable response to institutions that failed you—and somewhere along the way, distrust became default. You don't trust systems to improve, which means you don't fight for their improvement. Cynicism feels like wisdom. Often it's just exhaustion wearing a smarter outfit.</p><p>Independence was your survival strategy, and survival strategies become prisons. You don't ask for help because you learned nobody was coming. You figure things out alone because that's what latchkey kids do. But adulthood isn't childhood, and self-reliance can curdle into isolation. You've mistaken loneliness for strength. You've confused going it alone with being strong.</p><p>Irony was your generation's native tongue—a way to engage without being vulnerable, to participate without being exposed. But irony is distance, and distance has costs. You struggle to be earnest because earnestness feels dangerous. You hedge everything with self-deprecation. Your genuine passions come wrapped in 'I know this is stupid, but...' disclaimers. The protective layer has become a wall.</p><p>You've adapted so thoroughly to being overlooked that you've forgotten how to demand attention. Boomers take up space instinctively. Millennials complain loudly. You just... handle it. This stoicism reads as maturity, but resources go to whoever asks. You forgot to ask. You're still forgetting.</p><p>The biggest blind spot might be how you judge younger generations. You see their anxiety and call it fragility. You see their protests and call it performance. You survived your problems; why can't they? But the math is different now. Economic conditions shifted dramatically between your entry and theirs. Empathy requires remembering that different isn't the same as weaker.</p><p>Technology made you adaptable, but adaptability has limits. You remember analog fondly—maybe too fondly. There's a temptation to dismiss new platforms, new communication styles, new ways of being present. Sometimes you're right that the new thing is shallow. Sometimes you're the old person you swore you'd never become, complaining about kids and their phones while ignoring that you're on your phone complaining.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1991-2001):</strong> You entered adulthood in a recession and rode out of it into the longest economic expansion in American history. The '90s felt like possibility—the Cold War over, the internet emerging, the future arriving. You got your first real job, probably changed jobs twice, lived in apartments with too many roommates, dated people who were wrong for you, and slowly figured out who you wanted to be. You watched O.J. and Monica and Y2K. The decade ended with a stolen election and markets starting to wobble. Ominous, in retrospect.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2001-2011):</strong> This was supposed to be the settling decade, and then the world exploded. You were thirty on September 11. Old enough to have mortgages and children and responsibilities, young enough to be called up if wars got worse. The 2000s were fear and housing bubbles and wars that never ended. You bought a house because that's what adults did, watched its value double, then watched it collapse in 2008. By decade's end, you were forty, more cautious, less trusting, wondering what other surprises were waiting.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2011-2021):</strong> Recovery. The markets came back. Your career probably peaked or plateaued. You dealt with teenagers becoming adults, parents becoming patients. Middle age arrived with all its clichés—the reading glasses, the aching back, the realization that more time is behind you than ahead. Then COVID hit when you were forty-nine. You learned to Zoom, monitored your kids' remote schooling, worried about your parents' mortality, and wondered if stability was just something that happened between disasters.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2021-2031):</strong> You're here now, probably somewhere in the middle of this decade. Retirement is visible on the horizon—close enough to plan for, far enough to doubt. Your kids are adults navigating an economy worse than yours. Your parents need more, or they're already gone. You're senior enough at work to have actual power, or you've quietly disengaged, doing just enough, saving your energy for everything outside the office. This is the decade of deciding: push forward or coast to the finish.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2031+):</strong> Retirement for you won't look like your parents' version. Social Security will exist but won't be enough. Medicare helps but doesn't solve everything. You might work part-time, consult, finally write that book, finally take that trip. Your grandchildren will ask about the before-times—before internet, before smartphones, before everything was connected—and you'll tell them about Big Wheels and mix tapes and MTV and they won't believe you. Time turns everything into legend, eventually. Even you.</p>"

Jobs offered pensions when they worked. The social contract between employer and employee still existed when they signed up. They'll tell you they worked hard for what they have, and they did—but they also got to work in an economy that rewarded work. You worked just as hard. The math was worse. They control most of the wealth and most of the political power and seem confused about why younger generations are frustrated. You're used to them not understanding. You've been overlooked by Boomers your entire life.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> They graduated into the 2008 crater. You at least had fifteen good years first. They struggle to buy houses in cities; you probably own something, somewhere. They're drowning in student debt; your college was expensive but not bankruptcy-inducing. You have genuine sympathy for their position—you're not so old you've forgotten what entry-level struggle felt like—but mild irritation at their tendency to treat problems as unprecedented when Gen X faced them too, just quieter. They tweet complaints. You muttered and dealt with it. Neither approach is clearly better.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They've never known a world without the internet. You remember rotary phones and card catalogs and encyclopedias that came in sets of books. They communicate in memes and short videos. You still think email is efficient. They're more anxious, more medicated, more aware of systemic problems. You're not sure if their openness about mental health is progress or weakness. (It's progress.
