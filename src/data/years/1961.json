      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1961-1973</h2><p>You were born the year JFK told Americans to ask what they could do for their country, and your generation took that seriously—for better or worse. The Berlin Wall went up a few months after you arrived. Yuri Gagarin beat America to space. The Bay of Pigs invasion flopped spectacularly. Welcome to the Cold War, kid.</p><p>Your earliest memories formed during the most turbulent decade in modern American history. You were two when Kennedy was shot in Dallas. Five when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Seven when Bobby Kennedy was killed. Eight when men walked on the moon. Your childhood was a whiplash of tragedy and triumph, all broadcast on the family's black-and-white TV.</p><p>The Civil Rights Movement wasn't abstract history—it was happening in real-time while you learned to read. Vietnam escalated throughout your elementary school years. By the time you hit middle school, your older cousins and neighbors were getting drafted. The evening news was a nightly horror show that your parents watched with grim expressions.</p><p>Technology-wise, you grew up analog. Your phone had a rotary dial. Your TV had three channels, maybe four if the antenna cooperated. Air conditioning was a luxury. Your family's car had no seatbelts, and nobody thought twice about it. Summers meant running through the neighborhood until the streetlights came on.</p><p>You were twelve during Watergate. You watched Nixon resign on live television. The message was clear: authority figures lie, institutions fail, and the grown-ups don't actually know what they're doing. That skepticism would stick with you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That's the generation born in the post-war baby boom, when American soldiers came home victorious and started families at unprecedented rates. Your cohort is roughly 76 million people—the largest generation in American history until the Millennials showed up.</p><p>But you're a late Boomer, born in '61. That matters. The early Boomers—born in '46 or '47—were the Woodstock generation, the protesters, the draft dodgers. By the time you were old enough to protest anything, Vietnam was winding down and the counterculture had curdled into disco. You missed the revolution. You got the hangover.</p><p>Your defining moments were different from the early Boomers. They had the Summer of Love. You had Watergate. They went to Woodstock. You went to the mall. They dodged the draft. You registered for Selective Service but never worried much about it because the war was over.</p><p>Late Boomers are the forgotten middle children of their generation. Too young to be hippies, too old to be Gen X. You share some characteristics with both but belong fully to neither. You're pragmatic where early Boomers were idealistic, optimistic where Gen X became cynical.</p><p>Your generation transformed American culture, economics, and politics—and then refused to leave. Boomers have held power longer than any generation before, which younger generations find somewhere between frustrating and enraging. But you didn't ask for that either. You just happened to be born during the biggest demographic bulge in history.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year West Side Story swept the Oscars and Breakfast at Tiffany's made Audrey Hepburn an icon. The Twist was the dance craze. Ray Charles sang 'Hit the Road Jack.' The early '60s were still the tail end of the Eisenhower era—clean-cut, buttoned-up, carefully controlled.</p><p>Then the Beatles arrived when you were two. By the time you were seven, psychedelia had replaced pompadours. The cultural whiplash was disorienting even for the adults; for you, it was just what growing up felt like.</p><p>Your childhood TV was The Andy Griffith Show, The Beverly Hillbillies, Gilligan's Island. Simple, reassuring, completely at odds with what was actually happening in the world. Saturday mornings meant cartoons—The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo. After-school TV was reruns and local programming.</p><p>By your teenage years, the culture had fragmented. There was no monoculture anymore. Your older siblings listened to Led Zeppelin; your younger ones would listen to disco. You caught the pivot point. Your high school years gave you Jaws, Star Wars, Saturday Night Fever, and Animal House. Movies became events again.</p><p>You graduated high school the same year MTV launched. You were the first generation to see music videos as they debuted. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' came out when you were 22. Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' when you were 23. The '80s belonged to you in your twenties—the big hair, the synthesizers, the excess.</p><p>Your pop culture references span from Motown to MTV, from JFK to Reagan, from black-and-white TV to cable. You've watched entertainment evolve from three networks to 500 channels to infinite streaming. Every format you ever owned is now obsolete.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year IBM introduced the Selectric typewriter—cutting-edge office technology in 1961. Computers existed, but they filled entire rooms and were operated by technicians in lab coats. The idea of a 'personal computer' would have sounded like science fiction.</p><p>Your childhood was pre-digital in every way. Calculators didn't exist in consumer form until you were in middle school. Pong, the first video game anyone played at home, came out when you were eleven. The microwave oven became mainstream when you were a teenager. These were the technologies that seemed revolutionary.</p><p>You were 20 when IBM released the personal computer. 23 when Apple launched Macintosh. 28 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. The internet existed for your entire adult life, but you remember vividly when it didn't. You learned to type on a typewriter, then had to relearn on a computer keyboard.</p><p>Cell phones arrived when you were in your thirties. They were bricks. They cost a fortune. By your forties, everyone had one. By your fifties, smartphones had made them obsolete. You've carried a device in your pocket that's more powerful than the computers NASA used to land on the moon.</p><p>You adapted to technology, but you didn't grow up with it. The distinction matters. You can use a smartphone, but you remember when phones were attached to walls. You can navigate the internet, but you remember when research meant going to the library. You've lived in two technological eras, fluent in both, native to neither.</p><p>This makes you valuable in ways younger generations don't always appreciate. You know how things worked before they were automated. You can troubleshoot because you understand the underlying logic, not just the interface. You're analog-literate in a digital world.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born into the Cold War's most dangerous years. The Berlin Wall went up months after your birth. The Cuban Missile Crisis happened when you were one—the closest humanity ever came to nuclear annihilation. Your parents probably remember those thirteen days in October 1962 with crystal clarity.</p><p>You were two when JFK was shot in Dallas. You don't remember it, but everyone older than you does. It was the moment American innocence died, they'll tell you. The Zapruder film became the first viral video in history, replayed endlessly, analyzed obsessively.</p><p>You were seven when MLK and RFK were assassinated within two months of each other. You were eight when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon—the one unambiguously triumphant moment of your childhood. Your family probably gathered around the TV, watching grainy footage from 238,000 miles away.</p><p>Vietnam was the background noise of your entire childhood. You watched the war on the evening news—body counts, napalm, protests. You were ten during the Kent State shootings, when National Guardsmen killed four college students. The war ended when you were fourteen. By then, everyone was exhausted.</p><p>Watergate consumed your early adolescence. You watched the hearings, the Saturday Night Massacre, the resignation. You were thirteen when Nixon left office in disgrace. The cynicism that generated—toward government, toward authority, toward official narratives—shaped your generation's worldview permanently.</p><p>You were 19 when Reagan was shot, 20 when he survived and became a symbol of resilience. You were 25 when the Challenger exploded on live TV. 28 when the Berlin Wall came down. 30 when the Soviet Union collapsed. 40 during 9/11. 47 during the 2008 financial crisis. 59 when COVID-19 shut down the world.</p><p>You've lived through more history than most people can process. The world you were born into—segregated, Cold War, pre-digital—is unrecognizable from the one you live in now.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1979-1983, depending on whether you went to college. The economy was in stagflation—high inflation, high unemployment, low growth. Interest rates hit 20%. It wasn't great, but it wasn't catastrophic either. You found work. Most people did.</p><p>The '80s were good to you, economically speaking. Reagan's tax cuts, deregulation, and the bull market created opportunities. If you had any skill with computers, you were golden. If you got into finance, you printed money. The yuppie era was your twenties and early thirties.</p><p>You're the generation that invented modern corporate culture—the cubicles, the middle management, the PowerPoint presentations. You climbed corporate ladders that actually led somewhere. Promotions happened. Raises were real. Pensions still existed when you started working, even if they were disappearing by the time you hit middle management.</p><p>The dot-com boom happened when you were in your late thirties. Some of you got rich. Some of you got lucky. Some of you got caught in the bust. But by then, you had enough tenure and savings to weather it.</p><p>You're probably at or near the end of your career now. Maybe you're retired. Maybe you're consulting. Maybe you can't afford to stop working because retirement savings aren't what they should be. The 2008 crash hit your 401(k) right when you needed it most.</p><p>Your career spanned the transformation from typewriters to computers, from faxes to email, from offices to remote work. You adapted to every technological shift, usually learning just enough to stay relevant. The younger workers who grew up digital sometimes don't appreciate how much you had to learn along the way.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the Sexual Revolution, though by the time you were old enough to participate, the revolution was becoming complicated. AIDS emerged when you were in your early twenties, fundamentally reshaping dating and intimacy for your generation.</p><p>You probably met your partner in person—at school, at work, through friends, at a bar. Dating apps wouldn't exist for another three decades. Courtship meant phone calls, not texts. You asked people out face-to-face, which required courage that swipe-based dating doesn't demand.</p><p>Your generation married earlier than those who came after. The median age at first marriage when you were 25 was about 23 for women and 25 for men. If you followed that pattern, you've been married for 35-40 years. Divorce rates peaked in the early '80s, so statistically, about half of you stayed married.</p><p>Communication meant letters, phone calls, and eventually email. You remember when long-distance calls were expensive, when you had to wait for the right moment to reach someone. The always-connected world feels both convenient and exhausting.</p><p>Your kids—if you have them—are probably Millennials or older Gen Z. You raised them through the transition from analog to digital childhood. You set rules about TV time that became obsolete when screens multiplied. You tried to protect them from an internet you didn't fully understand.</p><p>Your relationship with technology in relationships is ambivalent. You appreciate being able to video-call grandchildren, but you miss when people put down their phones at dinner. You've adapted to texting, but you remember when presence meant physical presence.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by parents who survived the Depression. 'Waste not, want not' wasn't a slogan—it was a survival strategy. You grew up with frugality as a virtue, even as post-war prosperity made frugality increasingly optional.</p><p>You entered adulthood during stagflation and came of age during the Reagan boom. This gave you a peculiar optimism: things can be bad, but they get better. You've seen economic cycles complete themselves. You know recessions end. This makes you calmer about market volatility than younger generations who've only known instability.</p><p>You're the last generation with pensions. Maybe not universal, but common enough. You understood that loyalty to an employer was rewarded with security in old age. That compact broke for the generations behind you. They got 401(k)s—'defined contribution' instead of 'defined benefit'—and the risk shifted from employers to employees.</p><p>Housing was affordable when you bought. The median home price in 1985 was about $75,000—roughly three times median household income. You might have bought your first house for less than your current car costs. This is incomprehensible to anyone under 40.</p><p>Your generation accumulated wealth in ways that now seem impossible. You bought real estate before prices went parabolic. You invested during a 40-year bull market. You benefited from tax policies that favored homeowners and investors. Whether you feel wealthy or not, statistically, your generation controls more wealth than any in history.</p><p>The criticism from younger generations—that Boomers pulled the ladder up behind them—stings because there's truth in it. You didn't mean to. You just followed the rules that existed. But the rules changed, and the generations behind you are playing a different, harder game.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest weakness is a certainty that your way worked, therefore it must still work. 'I paid my way through college working summers' is technically true and practically meaningless when tuition has increased 1,200% since you graduated.</p><p>You have trouble seeing how much the economy has changed. When you bought a house for $60,000 with a $30,000 salary, you weren't doing anything special—you were just buying a house. When you tell someone making $50,000 to just 'save for a down payment' on a $500,000 house, you're not giving advice—you're revealing that you haven't done the math.</p><p>Technology is a blind spot. You learned to use it, but you don't always understand it. You forward chain emails, fall for phishing scams, and share misinformation on Facebook because the internet didn't come with critical thinking training for your generation. Digital literacy isn't intuitive when you spent your formative years in an analog world.</p><p>Your generation's optimism, which served you well, has curdled into a refusal to acknowledge how bad things have gotten for younger people. 'Every generation thinks they have it worse' is a thought-terminating cliché that prevents you from seeing real decline in living standards, mental health, and economic mobility.</p><p>You're the generation that said 'don't trust anyone over 30' and then never left power. The cognitive dissonance is significant. You disrupted your parents' world and then resisted every disruption that came for yours. The counterculture became the culture, and you stopped questioning it.</p><p>Climate change is largely your generation's doing, though you didn't know it at the time. The problem is that many of you still act like you didn't know—resistant to changes that might affect your lifestyle, skeptical of science that younger generations accept as basic reality.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1981-1991):</strong> Reagan was president for most of it. The economy recovered from stagflation. You established your career, probably married, possibly had kids. AIDS emerged and reshaped how everyone thought about sex and mortality. The Cold War wound down. The Berlin Wall fell. You entered your thirties watching the Soviet Union collapse, feeling like your side had won.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1991-2001):</strong> Clinton era. The economy boomed. The internet emerged. You were young enough to adapt, established enough to benefit. Your kids—if you had them—were in elementary or middle school. You probably bought a bigger house, maybe your first investment property. The stock market seemed like it could only go up. Y2K came and went without apocalypse.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2001-2011):</strong> 9/11 hit when you were 40. The dot-com bust had already deflated the bubble. The 2008 financial crisis arrived just as you were entering your peak earning years. Your 401(k) cratered. Your house lost value. Your kids were heading to college just as education costs went parabolic. This decade was harder than you expected.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2011-2021):</strong> Recovery. Sort of. The Obama years, then Trump. Your kids launched—or didn't, because the economy made launching difficult. You became grandparents, maybe. You started thinking seriously about retirement. Your parents aged, declined, passed. You became the oldest generation in your family. COVID-19 hit when you were 59, just as you were planning your exit from the workforce.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2021-2031):</strong> You're in this decade now. Retirement, if you can afford it. Health becomes a daily consideration instead of a theoretical concern. Your body tells you things you'd rather not hear. The world your grandchildren are growing up in is unrecognizable from the one you knew. You've become what you swore you'd never become: the older generation that doesn't understand the younger one.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2031+):</strong> Late-stage life in a world transformed by climate change, technology, and political shifts you can't predict. Your generation will be remembered as the one that had it all—opportunity, wealth, power—and the debate will be whether you used it wisely or squandered it. History will judge. You won't be around to argue.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4.2 million people born in 1961. The entire Baby Boom generation is about 76 million people in the US, making it the largest generation until Millennials overtook it around 2019.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you had it easier in almost every measurable way. They grew up during the Depression and fought in World War II or Korea. You grew up during unprecedented prosperity and avoided Vietnam by being too young. They were conformist; you questioned everything. They built institutions; you critiqued them.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you had better economic timing. You entered the workforce before the ladder was pulled up. You bought houses when they were affordable. You had pensions. Gen X got none of that. They're the first generation to do worse than their parents, a pattern that's continued ever since.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), the contrast is stark. You graduated into opportunity; they graduated into the Great Recession. You could pay for college with a summer job; they graduated with crushing debt. You bought houses in your twenties; they can't afford them in their forties. The resentment is real and mostly justified.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from a different planet. They've never known a world without internet, smartphones, or climate anxiety. They communicate in ways you don't fully understand. They've given up on institutions you still believe in. They're angrier and more radical because they have less to lose.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've already beaten that. Medical advances have extended lifespans, though they've also extended the period of decline. Quality of life in old age is better than your parents had, but it's expensive. Healthcare costs consume an ever-larger share of retirement savings.</p><p>Your generation changed the world in ways both celebrated and criticized. You advanced civil rights, transformed culture, built the technological infrastructure of modern life. You also accumulated wealth you didn't share, accelerated climate change, and held power well past your sell-by date. The full accounting is still being written.</p>"
