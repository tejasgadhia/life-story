      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1961-1973</h2><p>The smell of Coppertone suntan lotion. The satisfying click of Lincoln Logs locking into place. The weight of a View-Master against your face, clicking through those 3D reels of Disneyland and the Grand Canyon. Your childhood had a texture that kids today will never know—everything was physical, tactile, earned through patience.</p><p>At three, you were watching Captain Kangaroo every morning, waiting for Mr. Green Jeans and Bunny Rabbit. By five, you'd graduated to The Flintstones in prime time—a cartoon for the whole family, sponsored by Winston cigarettes. You probably had strong opinions about whether Fred or Barney was funnier. Your parents laughed at jokes you didn't understand yet.</p><p>Your toys were a statement of the era. Barbie had just arrived—the original in her black-and-white swimsuit. GI Joe showed up when you were three, and suddenly boys had their own fashion doll (though nobody called it that). Slot car racing consumed entire Saturday afternoons. Etch A Sketch let you draw and erase forever. Easy-Bake Oven turned a lightbulb into magic.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant one thing: cartoons. You parked yourself in front of the TV for The Jetsons, Top Cat, and The Bugs Bunny Show. The distinct smell of that old television—warm tubes and dust. The crushing disappointment when the test pattern appeared and you knew it was over. The backup plan of playing outside that your parents always insisted on.</p><p>You ate Swanson TV dinners in their aluminum trays, the compartments keeping your Salisbury steak separate from your mashed potatoes. You drank Tang because the astronauts drank Tang (or so the commercials claimed). You begged for Sugar Pops and Count Chocula. You learned to make Jiffy Pop on the stove, watching the foil dome rise like a silver balloon.</p><p>At two, President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, and you watched adults cry over someone they'd never met. You didn't understand it then—the collective grief, the way strangers could feel like family through a screen, the first assassination of the television age. You understand it now.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The word became shorthand for a generation that changed everything—and then, critics say, refused to let anyone else have a turn. But you're not the Boomer of the stereotypes. You're a late Boomer, born in '61, and that distinction matters more than most people realize.</p><p>You were eight years old when Woodstock happened. Eight. While the early Boomers were dropping acid and talking about revolution, you were watching The Wonderful World of Disney on Sunday nights and collecting baseball cards. The Summer of Love was 1967—you were six. The counterculture wasn't your culture. It was your older siblings' and cousins', something you observed through a child's eyes.</p><p>Your generation spans 1946 to 1964—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans, the largest generation in history until Millennials overtook you. But that span covers two very different experiences. The early Boomers remember JFK's election as adults. You remember his assassination as a toddler. They protested Vietnam. You were too young to be drafted and too young to protest meaningfully. They had the revolution. You got the aftermath.</p><p>The 1970s were your teenage years, and they were nothing like the 1960s. Gas lines, stagflation, Watergate, the fall of Saigon. The optimism of the Kennedy era had curdled into cynicism. You came of age watching institutions fail—the presidency, the economy, the American project itself seemed to be crumbling. Your older Boomer siblings had idealism. You had realism.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">You're sandwiched between the early Boomers (who got Woodstock and cheap houses) and Gen X (who got grunge and cheaper cynicism).</span> You share some DNA with both but belong fully to neither. You're pragmatic where early Boomers were idealistic. You're hopeful where Gen X became sardonic. You're the forgotten middle children of the largest generation in American history.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>West Side Story swept the Oscars the year you were born—finger-snapping gang warfare, 'I Feel Pretty,' Romeo and Juliet in Spanish Harlem. Breakfast at Tiffany's made Audrey Hepburn an icon. The Twist was the dance craze that scandalized parents. These weren't your movies, but they were in the air, replayed on television throughout your childhood until you absorbed them through cultural osmosis.</p><p>Your actual pop culture education started with the British Invasion. You were three when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan—73 million people watching four mop-topped boys from Liverpool. By five, you could sing along to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'Help!' even if you didn't understand what you were singing. The Rolling Stones seemed dangerous. The Beach Boys made California sound like paradise.</p><p>At six, The Sound of Music taught you that nuns could be cool and Austria was full of Nazis. At seven, you probably saw Mary Poppins at the local movie palace. At eight, you watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. Every kid in America wanted to be an astronaut that summer. You probably did too.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred. The Flintstones had moved to weekends by then. You watched Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, and The Herculoids. Scooby-Doo premiered when you were eight—and Shaggy became the template for every stoner character since. You learned all the Schoolhouse Rock songs without realizing you were learning. 'Conjunction Junction' is still in your head.</p><p>Your teenage years gave you the blockbuster era. Jaws when you were fourteen—suddenly everyone was afraid of sharks and beaches. Star Wars when you were sixteen—suddenly everyone wanted lightsabers and spaceships. Saturday Night Fever and Animal House when you were seventeen. Grease and Superman when you graduated. Movies became events, midnight showings, cultural moments.</p><p>Then MTV launched when you were twenty, and music became visual. You watched the first video ever played—'Video Killed the Radio Star'—and you got the joke. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' when you were twenty-two turned a music video into a short film. Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' when you were twenty-three made parents clutch their pearls. The '80s belonged to you.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The sound of a rotary phone dial is burned into your memory. That satisfying mechanical whir as the dial returned to zero, one digit at a time. Long-distance calls were expensive—you kept them short. Phone numbers started with words: PEnnsylvania 6-5000, BUtterfield 8. You memorized your friends' numbers because you had to.</p><p>At three, you experienced television in black and white. Three channels, maybe four if you could get PBS. No remote control—you were the remote control. The vertical hold would slip, and the picture would roll, and your dad would smack the side of the set. The test pattern came on at midnight because broadcasting just stopped.</p><p>Pocket calculators arrived when you were in middle school. They cost $400 at first—more than a month's rent. By high school, they were cheap enough for students. Your teachers insisted you still needed to learn to do math by hand. They were right, but you resented it anyway.</p><p>At eleven, Pong appeared in arcades. A white dot bouncing between two white paddles on a black screen. It was hypnotic. It was revolutionary. It was the first video game most people ever played. By your late teens, Space Invaders and Asteroids had taken over. You fed quarters into machines at the local arcade, chasing high scores.</p><p>You were twenty when the IBM PC launched, twenty-three when Macintosh arrived with that friendly beige face. The idea of a 'personal' computer still seemed extravagant—what would you even do with it? But you learned, because that's what your generation does. You adapted.</p><p>At twenty-eight, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, though you didn't know it yet. Email arrived in your thirties. Cell phones—actual bricks you carried—in your forties. Smartphones in your fifties. You've watched the entire digital revolution unfold in real time. You remember what it was like before, which makes you either a valuable bridge or hopelessly outdated, depending on who's asking.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were three months old when the Berlin Wall went up—concrete and barbed wire splitting a city, a country, a world in two. The Cold War was abstract for you, but your parents felt it in their bones. They'd grown up with duck-and-cover drills. They knew what the flash of nuclear light would look like.</p><p>At one, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of annihilation. Thirteen days in October 1962. Your parents probably remember exactly where they were, wondering if tomorrow would come. For you, it's a chapter in a history book. For them, it was the realest fear they ever felt.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were two when Kennedy was shot in Dallas. November 22, 1963.</span> You don't remember it—you were too young—but you grew up in its shadow. The adults around you never forgot where they were. It was the first assassination of the television age, replayed endlessly, the Zapruder film burned into national memory.</p><p>At seven, Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles. The spring of 1968 felt like the country was coming apart at the seams. You were in second grade. You didn't fully understand, but you understood that the adults were scared.</p><p>At eight, you watched men walk on the moon. July 20, 1969. Your family probably gathered around the television, watching those grainy images from 238,000 miles away. 'That's one small step for man.' For one moment, everyone on Earth looked up together. Nothing that pure would happen again in your lifetime.</p><p>Vietnam was the background noise of your childhood—body counts on the evening news, protest footage, your older cousins and neighbors getting drafted. The war ended when you were fourteen. Saigon fell. Helicopters evacuated the embassy. By then, everyone was just tired. At thirteen, you watched Nixon resign in disgrace. You were old enough to understand what Watergate meant: the grown-ups had been lying all along.</p><p>At twenty-five, Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after launch. You watched it live—or you watched the replays, over and over, that plume of smoke forking against the blue sky. At twenty-eight, the Berlin Wall came down. At thirty, the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War you'd been born into just... ended. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, 9/11.</span> At forty-seven, the financial system collapsed. At fifty-nine, a pandemic shut down the world. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. You've lived through more 'unprecedented' events than most generations see in a lifetime.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about timing—the invisible force that shaped your entire career.</p><p>You graduated high school in 1979, college (if you went) around 1983. The economy was in stagflation—high inflation, high unemployment, interest rates that hit 20%. Jimmy Carter talked about malaise. Gas lines stretched around blocks. It felt like America's best days were behind it.</p><p>Then Reagan happened. The economy recovered. The stock market took off. The 1980s were good to you in ways that younger generations can barely imagine. Entry-level jobs existed. Promotions happened. Raises were real. If you showed up, worked hard, and didn't actively sabotage yourself, you moved up. The social contract between employers and employees still held.</p><p>Pensions. You might have actually had one—or at least started with one before they were replaced by 401(k)s. The defined benefit plan that your parents took for granted was disappearing, but you caught the tail end. Your retirement was supposed to be guaranteed. For the generations behind you, retirement became a gamble.</p><p>You're the generation that built modern corporate culture. The cubicle farms, the middle management layers, the performance reviews and quarterly objectives. PowerPoint was invented for you. Corporate retreats were invented for you. 'Synergy' was invented for you, though you probably cringe at the word now.</p><p>The dot-com boom happened in your late thirties. Some of you got stock options. Some of you got rich. Some of you got caught when the bubble burst. But by then, you had tenure, savings, a house. You could weather the storm. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and you watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> Some of you never fully recovered.</p><p>COVID proved you could work from home, which your employers had insisted was impossible for decades. You adapted, because that's what you do. You learned Zoom, figured out Slack, made peace with the camera in your home office. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The younger workers sometimes forget that you weren't born knowing this stuff. You had to learn it, again and again, as the world kept changing under your feet.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when having a crush meant hoping to see them at the sock hop, the drive-in, the football game? When getting their phone number meant asking for it out loud, in person, where everyone could see you get rejected? When calling meant talking to their parents first, praying they'd say 'hold on, I'll get them'?</p><p>You learned to flirt in person. There was no other way. Eye contact across the cafeteria. Passing notes in class. The slow dance at prom, hands sweaty, heart pounding. The drive to Make-Out Point (every town had one) in your dad's borrowed car. Romance required physical presence and actual courage.</p><p>The Sexual Revolution happened, but by the time you were old enough to participate, things had gotten complicated. AIDS emerged in 1981, when you were twenty. It changed everything—dating, intimacy, the carefree sexuality your older siblings had enjoyed. Your generation learned that love could kill you. That lesson shaped how you approached relationships for the rest of your life.</p><p>You probably met your partner the old-fashioned way. At school, at work, through friends, at a bar, at church. Dating apps didn't exist. 'Meeting someone online' meant you were probably a weirdo. The randomness of real-life encounter—that person who happened to sit next to you in class, who happened to be at that party—determined the course of your life.</p><p>If you followed the timeline, you married in your mid-twenties. You've been with your partner for thirty-five, forty years. That's rarer than it used to be—divorce rates peaked in the early '80s—but you're part of the cohort that made it work. Or didn't, and started over, which takes its own kind of courage.</p><p>Your kids, if you have them, are probably Millennials or older Gen Z. You raised them through the transition from analog to digital childhood. You set rules about Nintendo and MTV that became obsolete when smartphones put infinite content in their pockets. You tried to protect them from an internet you didn't fully understand. You're still not sure if you succeeded.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents survived the Great Depression. They didn't just remember it—they were shaped by it, permanently, in ways that seemed paranoid to your generation. They saved aluminum foil. They reused tea bags. They paid cash for everything because debt was shameful. 'Waste not, want not' wasn't a slogan—it was survival wisdom passed down like an heirloom.</p><p>You inherited their caution but not their scarcity. You grew up in unprecedented prosperity—the golden age of the American middle class. One income could support a family, buy a house, take vacations. This seemed normal to you. It was historically unprecedented, and it wouldn't last, but you didn't know that yet.</p><p>The numbers tell the story. When you were ready to buy your first house—let's say 1985—the median home price was about <span class=\"stat-box\">$75,000</span>. The median household income was around <span class=\"stat-box\">$25,000</span>. A house cost three years' salary. Today, that same house costs six to eight years' salary, assuming you can find one at all. <span class=\"pull-quote\">You bought into a market that was still accessible. The generations behind you face a different equation entirely.</span></p><p>You're the last generation with real pensions. Defined benefit plans—the ones where your employer promised you a specific monthly payment in retirement—still existed when you entered the workforce. They were already dying, but you caught the tail end. The 401(k), that 'defined contribution' experiment where all the risk shifted from employers to employees, became the default for everyone who came after.</p><p>Your relationship with money is shaped by paradox. You inherited Depression-era caution from parents who'd learned scarcity firsthand. You experienced postwar abundance that made that caution seem quaint. Then you watched inflation devour savings in the '70s, markets crash in '87, '01, and '08. Each cycle reinforced the lesson: security is an illusion, but you keep chasing it anyway.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">The financial decisions facing you now involve questions your parents never had to answer.</span> How long will you live? How much healthcare will cost? Whether Social Security will survive? Estate planning has become its own industry because the transfer of wealth between generations is complicated by tax law, family dynamics, and the uncomfortable math of helping adult children who can't afford what you could at their age.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation said 'Don't trust anyone over thirty.' Now you're twice that age and still holding the reins. The irony isn't lost on younger generations, even if it's lost on you.</p><p>The biggest blind spot is arithmetic. 'I paid my way through college working summers' is technically true and practically meaningless. Minimum wage in 1979 was $2.90 per hour. Annual tuition at a public university was about $800. You could pay for a year of college with 276 hours of work—about seven weeks full-time. Today, the same calculation requires over 1,500 hours. The math changed. The advice didn't.</p><p>You have trouble seeing how much the economy has shifted because your reference point is obsolete. When you bought your first house, you weren't doing anything impressive—you were just buying a house, like everyone did. When you tell a thirty-year-old making $60,000 to 'just save for a down payment' on a $600,000 house, you're not offering advice. You're revealing that you haven't updated your mental model in decades.</p><p>Technology is another blind spot. You learned to use it—you adapted, you always do—but you don't always understand it. The phishing emails that seem obvious to your grandchildren fool you because you didn't grow up with digital skepticism built into your operating system. The misinformation you share on Facebook spreads because you were raised to trust printed words, and the internet looks like print.</p><p>Your optimism, which served you so well, can become a barrier to understanding. 'Every generation thinks they have it worse' is a thought-terminating cliché that lets you dismiss real changes in living standards and economic mobility. The instinct to reassure—'things will work out'—sometimes prevents you from hearing what younger people are actually experiencing.</p><p>Climate change happened on your watch. Not on purpose—you didn't know, not really, not when it mattered. But here you are, navigating a world where the consequences are arriving. Your grandchildren will inherit what remains. The question isn't guilt—it's what you do with the awareness, however late it arrived.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1981-1991):</strong> Reagan was president for most of it. You entered the workforce during stagflation, watched the economy recover, and rode the wave of 1980s prosperity. MTV launched. AIDS emerged. The Space Shuttle flew and then exploded. You probably married, possibly had kids. Your first house cost less than a new car costs today. The Cold War wound down. The Berlin Wall fell. You entered your thirties watching the Soviet Union collapse, feeling like the good guys had won, like history had ended and things would only get better.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1991-2001):</strong> Clinton era prosperity. The economy boomed. The internet emerged—weird and new, full of promise. You were young enough to adapt, established enough to benefit. Your kids were in elementary and middle school. You coached Little League, attended recitals, tried to figure out parenting without a manual. You probably upgraded to a bigger house, maybe started investing beyond your 401(k). The dot-com bubble felt like free money. Y2K came and went without apocalypse.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2001-2011):</strong> September 11th hit when you were forty. You remember exactly where you were. The world changed that morning—security lines, forever wars, a country that never quite felt the same. The 2008 financial crisis arrived just as your kids were heading to college. Your 401(k) lost 40%. Your house lost value. You'd planned for this decade to be your peak earning years. Instead, you white-knuckled through two recessions and wondered if the rules you'd followed still applied.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2011-2021):</strong> Recovery, eventually. Your kids launched into an economy that didn't want them. You helped where you could—co-signed loans, let them live at home, worried about their futures in ways your parents never had to worry about yours. You became grandparents, maybe. Your own parents aged, declined, passed. You became the oldest generation in your family. COVID-19 hit when you were fifty-nine, just as you were planning your exit. Plans changed.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2021-2031):</strong> You're here now, somewhere in this decade. Retirement, if you can afford it—and many can't, not the way you imagined. Health becomes a daily negotiation. Your body has opinions you can't ignore. The world your grandchildren inhabit is foreign in ways that go beyond technology. You've become what you swore you'd never become: the older generation that doesn't quite understand the younger one. That's not failure. That's just time.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2031+):</strong> Late-stage life in a world transformed by climate change, artificial intelligence, and political shifts nobody can predict. Your generation will be remembered as the one that had everything—opportunity, wealth, power, numbers. The debate about whether you used it wisely will continue long after you're gone. History is still being written. Your part in it is almost complete.</p>"

The demographic bulge you represent has shaped American politics, economics, and culture for six decades.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They lived through the Depression as children, fought in World War II and Korea as young adults. You inherited their prosperity without their scarcity. They built the institutions you grew up questioning. They were conformist; you made 'question authority' a bumper sticker. They sacrificed; you benefited. The debt they're owed is rarely acknowledged.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> You got jobs; they got told to lower their expectations. You got pensions; they got 401(k)s and market volatility. You bought houses at three times your salary; they watched prices climb out of reach. Gen X is the first American generation to do worse than their parents—a pattern that started with them and hasn't stopped.

They've never known a world without internet, smartphones, or climate anxiety. They communicate in ways you don't fully parse. They've given up on institutions you still believe can be reformed. They're more radical because they have less to lose. They might save the world. They might burn it down. They're definitely not listening to advice from people who got them into this mess.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. You've beaten that, thanks to medical advances your generation helped fund. Quality of life in old age is better than your parents had—but it's expensive, and healthcare costs consume more of your retirement than anyone planned for.</p><p>Your legacy is contested. You advanced civil rights, transformed culture, built the technological infrastructure of modern life. You also accumulated wealth you haven't shared, accelerated climate change you won't fix, and held power long past the point where fresh ideas might have helped. The final accounting will be written by generations who inherit what you leave behind.</p>"
