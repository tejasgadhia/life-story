      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1961-1973</h2><p>The smell of Coppertone suntan lotion. The satisfying click of Lincoln Logs locking into place. The weight of a View-Master against a child's face, clicking through those 3D reels of Disneyland and the Grand Canyon. Childhood had a texture that kids today will never know—everything was physical, tactile, earned through patience.</p><p>At three, children were watching Captain Kangaroo every morning, waiting for Mr. Green Jeans and Bunny Rabbit. By five, they'd graduated to The Flintstones in prime time—a cartoon for the whole family, sponsored by Winston cigarettes. Strong opinions about whether Fred or Barney was funnier. Parents laughed at jokes children didn't understand yet.</p><p>Toys were a statement of the era. Barbie had just arrived—the original in her black-and-white swimsuit. GI Joe showed up when children were three, and suddenly boys had their own fashion doll (though nobody called it that). Slot car racing consumed entire Saturday afternoons. Etch A Sketch let children draw and erase forever. Easy-Bake Oven turned a lightbulb into magic.</p><p>Saturday mornings meant one thing: cartoons. Children parked themselves in front of the TV for The Jetsons, Top Cat, and The Bugs Bunny Show. The distinct smell of that old television—warm tubes and dust. The crushing disappointment when the test pattern appeared and broadcasting was over. The backup plan of playing outside that parents always insisted on.</p><p>Swanson TV dinners came in aluminum trays, the compartments keeping Salisbury steak separate from mashed potatoes. Tang because the astronauts drank Tang (or so the commercials claimed). Sugar Pops and Count Chocula. Learning to make Jiffy Pop on the stove, watching the foil dome rise like a silver balloon.</p><p>At two, President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, and children watched adults cry over someone they'd never met. The collective grief, the way strangers could feel like family through a screen, the first assassination of the television age. Understanding came later.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Boomer Generation</h2><p>Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. The name comes from the post-WWII birth spike that produced roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans, the largest generation in history until Millennials overtook them around 2019.</p><p>Those born in 1961 were eight years old when Woodstock happened. While the early Boomers were dropping acid and talking about revolution, late Boomers were watching The Wonderful World of Disney on Sunday nights and collecting baseball cards. The Summer of Love was 1967—they were six. The counterculture wasn't their culture. It was their older siblings' and cousins', something observed through a child's eyes.</p><p>The generation spans two very different experiences. The early Boomers remember JFK's election as adults. Late Boomers remember his assassination as toddlers. Early Boomers protested Vietnam. Late Boomers were too young to be drafted and too young to protest meaningfully. Early Boomers had the revolution. Late Boomers got the aftermath.</p><p>The 1970s were the teenage years for those born in 1961, and they were nothing like the 1960s. Gas lines, stagflation, Watergate, the fall of Saigon. The optimism of the Kennedy era had curdled into cynicism. Late Boomers came of age watching institutions fail—the presidency, the economy, the American project itself seemed to be crumbling. Early Boomer siblings had idealism. Late Boomers had realism.</p><p><span class=\"pull-quote\">Late Boomers are sandwiched between the early Boomers (who got Woodstock and cheap houses) and Gen X (who got grunge and cheaper cynicism).</span> They share some DNA with both but belong fully to neither. Pragmatic where early Boomers were idealistic. Hopeful where Gen X became sardonic. The forgotten middle children of the largest generation in American history.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>West Side Story swept the Oscars the year this cohort was born—finger-snapping gang warfare, 'I Feel Pretty,' Romeo and Juliet in Spanish Harlem. Breakfast at Tiffany's made Audrey Hepburn an icon. The Twist was the dance craze that scandalized parents. These weren't their movies, but they were in the air, replayed on television throughout childhood until absorbed through cultural osmosis.</p><p>The pop culture education started with the British Invasion. At three, the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan—73 million people watching four mop-topped boys from Liverpool. By five, children could sing along to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'Help!' even if they didn't understand what they were singing. The Rolling Stones seemed dangerous. The Beach Boys made California sound like paradise.</p><p>At six, The Sound of Music taught that nuns could be cool and Austria was full of Nazis. At seven, children probably saw Mary Poppins at the local movie palace. At eight, they watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. Every kid in America wanted to be an astronaut that summer.</p><p>Saturday mornings were sacred. The Flintstones had moved to weekends by then. Children watched Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, and The Herculoids. Scooby-Doo premiered when they were eight—and Shaggy became the template for every stoner character since. Schoolhouse Rock songs were learned without realizing they were learning. 'Conjunction Junction' is still in their heads.</p><p>The teenage years gave this cohort the blockbuster era. Jaws when they were fourteen—suddenly everyone was afraid of sharks and beaches. Star Wars when they were sixteen—suddenly everyone wanted lightsabers and spaceships. Saturday Night Fever and Animal House when they were seventeen. Grease and Superman when they graduated. Movies became events, midnight showings, cultural moments.</p><p>Then MTV launched when this cohort was twenty, and music became visual. The first video ever played—'Video Killed the Radio Star'—and they got the joke. Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' when they were twenty-two turned a music video into a short film. Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' when they were twenty-three made parents clutch their pearls. The '80s belonged to them.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>The sound of a rotary phone dial is burned into memory. That satisfying mechanical whir as the dial returned to zero, one digit at a time. Long-distance calls were expensive—kept short. Phone numbers started with words: PEnnsylvania 6-5000, BUtterfield 8. Friends' numbers were memorized because there was no other option.</p><p>At three, television was experienced in black and white. Three channels, maybe four if PBS could be received. No remote control—children were the remote control. The vertical hold would slip, and the picture would roll, and dad would smack the side of the set. The test pattern came on at midnight because broadcasting just stopped.</p><p>Pocket calculators arrived during middle school. They cost $400 at first—more than a month's rent. By high school, they were cheap enough for students. Teachers insisted students still needed to learn to do math by hand. They were right, but resentment was inevitable anyway.</p><p>At eleven, Pong appeared in arcades. A white dot bouncing between two white paddles on a black screen. Hypnotic. Revolutionary. The first video game most people ever played. By the late teens, Space Invaders and Asteroids had taken over. Quarters fed into machines at the local arcade, chasing high scores.</p><p>This cohort was twenty when the IBM PC launched, twenty-three when Macintosh arrived with that friendly beige face. The idea of a 'personal' computer still seemed extravagant—what would anyone even do with it? But they learned, because that's what this generation does. They adapted.</p><p>At twenty-eight, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, though nobody knew it yet. Email arrived in their thirties. Cell phones—actual bricks carried—in their forties. Smartphones in their fifties. The entire digital revolution unfolded in real time. They remember what it was like before, which makes them either a valuable bridge or hopelessly outdated, depending on who's asking.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>This cohort was three months old when the Berlin Wall went up—concrete and barbed wire splitting a city, a country, a world in two. The Cold War was abstract for children, but parents felt it in their bones. They'd grown up with duck-and-cover drills. They knew what the flash of nuclear light would look like.</p><p>At one, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of annihilation. Thirteen days in October 1962. Parents probably remember exactly where they were, wondering if tomorrow would come. For children, it's a chapter in a history book. For parents, it was the realest fear they ever felt.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">This cohort was two when Kennedy was shot in Dallas. November 22, 1963.</span> Too young to remember, but they grew up in its shadow. The adults around them never forgot where they were. It was the first assassination of the television age, replayed endlessly, the Zapruder film burned into national memory.</p><p>At seven, Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles. The spring of 1968 felt like the country was coming apart at the seams. Children were in second grade. They didn't fully understand, but they understood that the adults were scared.</p><p>At eight, they watched men walk on the moon. July 20, 1969. Families probably gathered around the television, watching those grainy images from 238,000 miles away. 'That's one small step for man.' For one moment, everyone on Earth looked up together. Nothing that pure would happen again in their lifetime.</p><p>Vietnam was the background noise of childhood—body counts on the evening news, protest footage, older cousins and neighbors getting drafted. The war ended when this cohort was fourteen. Saigon fell. Helicopters evacuated the embassy. By then, everyone was just tired. At thirteen, they watched Nixon resign in disgrace. Old enough to understand what Watergate meant: the grown-ups had been lying all along.</p><p>At twenty-five, Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after launch. Watched live—or watched the replays, over and over, that plume of smoke forking against the blue sky. At twenty-eight, the Berlin Wall came down. At thirty, the Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War they'd been born into just... ended. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, 9/11.</span> At forty-seven, the financial system collapsed. At fifty-nine, a pandemic shut down the world. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. This cohort has lived through more 'unprecedented' events than most generations see in a lifetime.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Timing shaped entire careers for this cohort.</p><p>They graduated high school in 1979, college (if they went) around 1983. The economy was in stagflation—high inflation, high unemployment, interest rates that hit 20%. Jimmy Carter talked about malaise. Gas lines stretched around blocks. It felt like America's best days were behind it.</p><p>Then Reagan happened. The economy recovered. The stock market took off. The 1980s were good to this cohort in ways that younger generations can barely imagine. Entry-level jobs existed. Promotions happened. Raises were real. If workers showed up, worked hard, and didn't actively sabotage themselves, they moved up. The social contract between employers and employees still held.</p><p>Pensions. This cohort might have actually had one—or at least started with one before they were replaced by 401(k)s. The defined benefit plan that their parents took for granted was disappearing, but they caught the tail end. Retirement was supposed to be guaranteed. For the generations behind them, retirement became a gamble.</p><p>This generation built modern corporate culture. The cubicle farms, the middle management layers, the performance reviews and quarterly objectives. PowerPoint was invented for them. Corporate retreats were invented for them. 'Synergy' was invented for them, though they probably cringe at the word now.</p><p>The dot-com boom happened in their late thirties. Some got stock options. Some got rich. Some got caught when the bubble burst. But by then, they had tenure, savings, a house. They could weather the storm. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and retirement plans evaporated overnight.</span> Some never fully recovered.</p><p>COVID proved work from home was possible, which employers had insisted was impossible for decades. This cohort adapted, because that's what they do. They learned Zoom, figured out Slack, made peace with the camera in home offices. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Younger workers sometimes forget that this generation wasn't born knowing this stuff. They had to learn it, again and again, as the world kept changing under their feet.</span></p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Having a crush meant hoping to see them at the sock hop, the drive-in, the football game. Getting their phone number meant asking for it out loud, in person, where everyone could see rejection happen. Calling meant talking to their parents first, praying they'd say 'hold on, I'll get them.'</p><p>This generation learned to flirt in person. There was no other way. Eye contact across the cafeteria. Passing notes in class. The slow dance at prom, hands sweaty, heart pounding. The drive to Make-Out Point (every town had one) in dad's borrowed car. Romance required physical presence and actual courage.</p><p>The Sexual Revolution happened, but by the time this cohort was old enough to participate, things had gotten complicated. AIDS emerged in 1981, when they were twenty. It changed everything—dating, intimacy, the carefree sexuality their older siblings had enjoyed. This generation learned that love could kill. That lesson shaped how they approached relationships for the rest of their lives.</p><p>They probably met partners the old-fashioned way. At school, at work, through friends, at a bar, at church. Dating apps didn't exist. 'Meeting someone online' meant they were probably a weirdo. The randomness of real-life encounter—that person who happened to sit next to them in class, who happened to be at that party—determined the course of their lives.</p><p>If they followed the timeline, they married in their mid-twenties. Many have been with their partners for thirty-five, forty years. That's rarer than it used to be—divorce rates peaked in the early '80s—but this cohort is part of the group that made it work. Or didn't, and started over, which takes its own kind of courage.</p><p>Their kids, if they have them, are probably Millennials or older Gen Z. They raised them through the transition from analog to digital childhood. They set rules about Nintendo and MTV that became obsolete when smartphones put infinite content in their pockets. They tried to protect them from an internet they didn't fully understand. They're still not sure if they succeeded.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Parents survived the Great Depression. They didn't just remember it—they were shaped by it, permanently, in ways that seemed paranoid to this generation. They saved aluminum foil. They reused tea bags. They paid cash for everything because debt was shameful. 'Waste not, want not' wasn't a slogan—it was survival wisdom passed down like an heirloom.</p><p>This cohort inherited their caution but not their scarcity. They grew up in unprecedented prosperity—the golden age of the American middle class. One income could support a family, buy a house, take vacations. This seemed normal. It was historically unprecedented, and it wouldn't last, but they didn't know that yet.</p><p>The numbers tell the story. When this cohort was ready to buy their first house—let's say 1985—the median home price was about <span class=\"stat-box\">$75,000</span>. The median household income was around <span class=\"stat-box\">$25,000</span>. A house cost three years' salary. Today, that same house costs six to eight years' salary, assuming one can find it at all. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They bought into a market that was still accessible. The generations behind them face a different equation entirely.</span></p><p>This is the last generation with real pensions. Defined benefit plans—the ones where employers promised a specific monthly payment in retirement—still existed when they entered the workforce. They were already dying, but this cohort caught the tail end. The 401(k), that 'defined contribution' experiment where all the risk shifted from employers to employees, became the default for everyone who came after.</p><p>Their relationship with money is shaped by paradox. They inherited Depression-era caution from parents who'd learned scarcity firsthand. They experienced postwar abundance that made that caution seem quaint. Then they watched inflation devour savings in the '70s, markets crash in '87, '01, and '08. Each cycle reinforced the lesson: security is an illusion, but they keep chasing it anyway.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">The financial decisions facing this cohort now involve questions their parents never had to answer.</span> How long will they live? How much will healthcare cost? Whether Social Security will survive? Estate planning has become its own industry because the transfer of wealth between generations is complicated by tax law, family dynamics, and the uncomfortable math of helping adult children who can't afford what this cohort could at their age.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation said 'Don't trust anyone over thirty.' Now they're twice that age and still holding the reins. The irony isn't lost on younger generations, even if it's lost on them.</p><p>This generation's biggest blind spot is arithmetic. 'I paid my way through college working summers' is technically true and practically meaningless. Minimum wage in 1979 was $2.90 per hour. Annual tuition at a public university was about $800. A year of college could be paid for with 276 hours of work—about seven weeks full-time. Today, the same calculation requires over 1,500 hours. The math changed. The advice didn't.</p><p>This cohort has trouble seeing how much the economy has shifted because their reference point is obsolete. When they bought their first house, they weren't doing anything impressive—they were just buying a house, like everyone did. When they tell a thirty-year-old making $60,000 to 'just save for a down payment' on a $600,000 house, they're not offering advice. They're revealing that they haven't updated their mental model in decades.</p><p>Technology is another blind spot. They learned to use it—they adapted, they always do—but they don't always understand it. The phishing emails that seem obvious to their grandchildren fool them because they didn't grow up with digital skepticism built into their operating system. The misinformation they share on Facebook spreads because they were raised to trust printed words, and the internet looks like print.</p><p>Their optimism, which served them so well, can become a barrier to understanding. 'Every generation thinks they have it worse' is a thought-terminating cliché that lets them dismiss real changes in living standards and economic mobility. The instinct to reassure—'things will work out'—sometimes prevents them from hearing what younger people are actually experiencing.</p><p>Climate change happened on their watch. Not on purpose—they didn't know, not really, not when it mattered. But here they are, navigating a world where the consequences are arriving. Their grandchildren will inherit what remains. The question isn't guilt—it's what they do with the awareness, however late it arrived.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Their 20s (1981-1991):</strong> Reagan was president for most of it. This cohort entered the workforce during stagflation, watched the economy recover, and rode the wave of 1980s prosperity. MTV launched. AIDS emerged. The Space Shuttle flew and then exploded. They probably married, possibly had kids. Their first house cost less than a new car costs today. The Cold War wound down. The Berlin Wall fell. They entered their thirties watching the Soviet Union collapse, feeling like the good guys had won, like history had ended and things would only get better.</p><p><strong>Their 30s (1991-2001):</strong> Clinton era prosperity. The economy boomed. The internet emerged—weird and new, full of promise. They were young enough to adapt, established enough to benefit. Their kids were in elementary and middle school. They coached Little League, attended recitals, tried to figure out parenting without a manual. They probably upgraded to a bigger house, maybe started investing beyond their 401(k). The dot-com bubble felt like free money. Y2K came and went without apocalypse.</p><p><strong>Their 40s (2001-2011):</strong> September 11th hit when they were forty. They remember exactly where they were. The world changed that morning—security lines, forever wars, a country that never quite felt the same. The 2008 financial crisis arrived just as their kids were heading to college. Their 401(k) lost 40%. Their house lost value. They'd planned for this decade to be their peak earning years. Instead, they white-knuckled through two recessions and wondered if the rules they'd followed still applied.</p><p><strong>Their 50s (2011-2021):</strong> Recovery, eventually. Their kids launched into an economy that didn't want them. They helped where they could—co-signed loans, let them live at home, worried about their futures in ways their parents never had to worry about theirs. They became grandparents, maybe. Their own parents aged, declined, passed. They became the oldest generation in their family. COVID-19 hit when they were fifty-nine, just as they were planning their exit. Plans changed.</p><p><strong>Their 60s (2021-2031):</strong> They're here now, somewhere in this decade. Retirement, if they can afford it—and many can't, not the way they imagined. Health becomes a daily negotiation. Their body has opinions they can't ignore. The world their grandchildren inhabit is foreign in ways that go beyond technology. They've become what they swore they'd never become: the older generation that doesn't quite understand the younger one. That's not failure. That's just time.</p><p><strong>Their 70s and beyond (2031+):</strong> Late-stage life in a world transformed by climate change, artificial intelligence, and political shifts nobody can predict. This generation will be remembered as the one that had everything—opportunity, wealth, power, numbers. The debate about whether they used it wisely will continue long after they're gone. History is still being written. Their part in it is almost complete.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p><span class=\"stat-box\">{{BIRTH_YEAR_COHORT}}</span> people were born in the US the same year—part of a <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> generation. This cohort is part of the Boomer generation—the largest in American history until Millennials overtook them around 2019. The demographic bulge they represent has shaped American politics, economics, and culture for six decades.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They lived through the Depression as children, fought in World War II and Korea as young adults. Boomers inherited their prosperity without their scarcity. They built the institutions Boomers grew up questioning. They were conformist; Boomers made 'question authority' a bumper sticker. They sacrificed; Boomers benefited. The debt they're owed is rarely acknowledged.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> Boomers got jobs; Gen X got told to lower their expectations. Boomers got pensions; Gen X got 401(k)s and market volatility. Boomers bought houses at three times their salary; Gen X watched prices climb out of reach. Gen X is the first American generation to do worse than their parents—a pattern that started with them and hasn't stopped. They're the forgotten middle child, sandwiched between Boomer dominance and Millennial discourse.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers control <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> Millennials control about 7%. Boomers graduated into opportunity; Millennials graduated into the Great Recession. Boomers paid for college with summer jobs; Millennials graduated with $30,000 in debt. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The wealth gap is mathematically significant.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They're from different planets. Gen Z has never known a world without internet, smartphones, or climate anxiety. They communicate in ways Boomers don't fully parse. They've given up on institutions Boomers still believe can be reformed. They're more radical because they have less to lose. They might save the world. They might burn it down. They're definitely not listening to advice from people who got them into this mess.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. This cohort has beaten that, thanks to medical advances their generation helped fund. Quality of life in old age is better than their parents had—but it's expensive, and healthcare costs consume more of retirement than anyone planned for.</p><p>Their legacy is contested. They advanced civil rights, transformed culture, built the technological infrastructure of modern life. They also accumulated wealth they haven't shared, accelerated climate change they won't fix, and held power long past the point where fresh ideas might have helped. The final accounting will be written by generations who inherit what they leave behind.</p>"
