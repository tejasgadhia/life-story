      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1994-2006</h2><p>You were born the year O.J. Simpson led police on a slow-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, 95 million Americans watching live—more than watched that year's Super Bowl. Somewhere between the real-time car chase and the courtroom drama that followed, America discovered it could not look away from spectacle. This would define the media landscape of your entire life.</p><p>Your first year coincided with the Rwandan genocide—800,000 people killed in 100 days while the world mostly watched. Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first Black president, ending apartheid. Kurt Cobain died in April. The World Wide Web was being born in research labs and garages, but your parents were still using phone books and encyclopedias. Amazon was founded that July in a garage.</p><p>You were four when Google launched, six during Columbine, seven on 9/11. These weren't news stories you'd read about later—they were the texture of your childhood, events that happened while you were learning to read and ride bikes. You grew up in the shadow of that September morning, watching adults process shock and fear they'd never expected, learning that the world was fragile in ways nobody had warned you about.</p><p>You were the last cohort to have an analog early childhood and a digital adolescence. You probably remember VHS tapes and Saturday morning cartoons before streaming existed. You had a CD player before an iPod. You called friends on landlines, memorizing their numbers, endured dial-up internet sounds, and learned to type on a keyboard before ever touching a touchscreen. Then everything accelerated.</p><p>By the time you were twelve, YouTube existed. By fourteen, the iPhone had launched. You didn't grow up with social media—you watched it colonize your life in real-time, platform by platform. MySpace came first, teaching you HTML through profile customization. Then Facebook, then everything else. You were among the first generation of teenagers to document every awkward moment online, not knowing it would follow you forever.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996—and you're near the tail end, which means you share some DNA with older Gen Z. Pew Research draws the line at 1996, so you made the cut by two years. Some researchers call your micro-generation 'Zillennials'—old enough to remember life before smartphones, young enough to have grown up on social media.</p><p>Your generation is roughly 72 million people in the US, making it the largest cohort until Gen Z started catching up. You grew up being told you were special, that you could be anything, that participation trophies meant everyone was a winner. Then you graduated into a crater and found out the trophies were participation, not victory.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. You were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}}—{{GRADE_AT_911}}.</span> Old enough to remember it clearly, young enough that it shaped your entire worldview rather than disrupting an existing one. <span class=\"pull-quote\">You don't remember a pre-9/11 America with much clarity.</span> Airport security, forever wars, surveillance culture—that's just how things were.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Your generation graduated into the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.</span> You were fourteen when Lehman Brothers collapsed, which meant you watched your parents' retirement accounts evaporate, watched neighbors lose homes, learned viscerally that financial security was fiction. By the time you entered the job market around 2016, the damage was embedded. Entry-level positions required five years of experience. Internships were unpaid. The gig economy wasn't liberation—it was the only option left.</p><p>Your generation spans 1981 to 1996—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Americans. You've been blamed for killing everything from casual dining to the diamond industry. The joke got old around the time you realized you couldn't afford rent, let alone diamonds. Millennials are sandwiched between Gen X (who got theirs before the economy collapsed) and Gen Z (who never expected to get anything in the first place). You're optimistic enough to believe things could get better, cynical enough to know they probably won't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Forrest Gump won Best Picture and The Lion King taught every kid in America that death was inevitable, your father figure could be murdered by his brother, and Elton John would be there to sing about it. Pulp Fiction came out, but you were too young to appreciate Tarantino's non-linear storytelling until you watched it at a sleepover a decade later and felt sophisticated.</p><p>Musically, 1994 was the year grunge peaked and died. Kurt Cobain's suicide in April made him a martyr and ended an era. Weezer released their Blue Album—irony and sincerity mixed in ways your generation would perfect. Green Day's Dookie went diamond and brought punk to the suburbs. Boyz II Men were everywhere. TLC warned about chasing waterfalls. The Notorious B.I.G. dropped Ready to Die. It was a strangely excellent year for music—an inflection point between decades.</p><p>TV in 1994 gave the world Friends, which would define sitcom aesthetics for the next decade and make everyone believe they could afford a massive Manhattan apartment on a barista's salary. ER launched the same night, making medical dramas appointment viewing. Ellen premiered. My So-Called Life lasted one perfect season before cancellation. The Simpsons was at its absolute peak.</p><p>Your childhood was peak Nickelodeon—Rugrats, Hey Arnold!, All That, the orange VHS tapes. You caught the tail end of the Disney Renaissance and the beginning of Pixar's dominance. Your adolescence belonged to MySpace profiles with auto-playing songs that announced your emotional state, emo music, and the endless debate about Fall Out Boy versus Panic! at the Disco.</p><p>You were thirteen when the first iPhone launched, which means you got a smartphone during your most formative social years. Your high school experience was documented on Facebook. Your college years were filtered through Instagram. The culture you consumed wasn't broadcast at you—it was something you participated in, remixed, and shared. That shift happened while you were watching.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Netscape Navigator launched, making the World Wide Web accessible to regular people for the first time. Marc Andreessen was twenty-three and had just built the browser that would start the dot-com boom and eventually consume the world. The internet was moving from research labs to living rooms, though your family's computer probably ran Windows 3.1 and couldn't go online at all yet.</p><p>Sony released the PlayStation in Japan your birth year—a console that would define gaming for your generation and prove that CD-ROMs were the future. Amazon was a bookstore operating out of Jeff Bezos's garage, which in retrospect was like watching a small fire that would eventually burn down everything.</p><p>You were four when Google launched. Six when the dot-com bubble burst, teaching adults that internet companies needed revenue, not just ideas. Seven during 9/11, which accelerated surveillance technology and security theater. Ten when Facebook opened to high schools. Twelve when the first iPhone arrived. You watched the smartphone revolution happen during your most formative years.</p><p>This makes you one of the last people to remember life before the internet was everywhere. You know what boredom felt like before screens could fill every empty moment. You remember printing MapQuest directions, going to Blockbuster, waiting a week to see photos you'd taken. You're fluent in both analog and digital, which is increasingly rare.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is intimate and complicated. You're native to social media in ways older Millennials aren't, but you remember life before it in ways Gen Z doesn't. You can troubleshoot your parents' Wi-Fi and explain memes to confused aunts. You're the translator between generations, fluent in both languages, belonging fully to neither.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were two months old when Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's first Black president, ending apartheid. The Rwandan genocide happened that same year—800,000 people murdered in 100 days while the world watched and mostly did nothing. Your birth year contained both historic hope and historic horror.</p><p>You were three when the Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people, including children in a daycare. It was domestic terrorism before anyone used that phrase commonly. You were five when Princess Diana died, and you probably don't remember it clearly, but you remember adults being upset, the endless funeral coverage, the collective grief performed on television.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You were seven during 9/11.</span> Second grade. You remember being sent home from school, or watching the towers fall on classroom TV, or coming home to parents who looked afraid in ways you'd never seen. Everything after divided into before and after. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq started soon after. You've never known an America not at war somewhere.</p><p>You were ten during Hurricane Katrina, watching a major American city drown while the government fumbled the response. Fourteen when the financial crisis hit—old enough to understand something was wrong, that your parents were worried, that the economy had broken. Obama was elected when you were fourteen—the first Black president, 'hope and change' as a slogan before it became ironic.</p><p>You were nineteen during Sandy Hook. Twenty-two when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. Twenty-two when Trump announced his campaign. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_COVID}}, a pandemic shut down the world.</span> You've lived through more destabilizing events by thirty than your grandparents experienced in entire lifetimes.</p><p>The through-line is disruption. Every time stability seemed possible, something shattered it. You've learned to expect crisis, to treat chaos as the baseline. This isn't pessimism—it's pattern recognition based on lived experience.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">You graduated college around {{COLLEGE_GRADUATION_YEAR}}</span>, depending on your education path. The 2008 financial crisis happened when you were fourteen—you watched older siblings and cousins struggle to find jobs, learned early that a college degree wasn't the golden ticket previous generations promised. By the time you graduated, the economy had technically recovered, but wages hadn't, and neither had expectations.</p><p>Your generation perfected the 'side hustle' because one job doesn't cover rent, let alone student loans. You've probably driven for Uber, delivered for DoorDash, sold things on Etsy, or monetized some skill on Fiverr. The gig economy isn't liberation—it's filling gaps that full-time employment used to cover. You're entrepreneurial by necessity, not choice.</p><p>You've worked in offices with ping-pong tables and cold brew on tap, performative perks masking the fact that you're salary-exempt and expected to answer Slack at midnight. You've been through rounds of layoffs, watched companies announce record profits while cutting headcount, learned that 'we're a family here' means 'we'll exploit your loyalty until quarterly earnings require otherwise.'</p><p>Remote work became normalized because of COVID, which hit when you were in your mid-twenties—early career, still establishing yourself. You'd barely figured out how offices worked before everyone went remote. You learned to build a career through screens, which is great preparation for whatever comes next but terrible for learning the informal skills that physical presence teaches.</p><p>You're in the early-to-mid stages of your career now. Your earning potential is theoretically ahead of you, but so is uncertainty. Climate change, AI disruption, political instability—the future your career needs to navigate doesn't look like any future previous generations planned for. You're building on shifting sand.</p><p>You've learned to list 'passion' on resumes because employers want you to care deeply about their mission while paying you barely enough to survive. You've watched younger Gen Z colleagues set firmer boundaries and wondered why you didn't think to do that earlier. You're senior enough now to mentor interns, junior enough to still feel expendable.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that grew up with dating apps as default infrastructure. Tinder launched when you were eighteen—you didn't adapt to swipe culture, you came of age inside it. For you, meeting people online isn't weird or novel. It's just how things work. Your parents find this baffling. Your Gen Z friends think any other method is inefficient.</p><p>You've probably had at least one relationship that happened primarily through text messages and DMs. You know the anxiety of read receipts that confirm they saw your message and chose silence. You know the calculation of response timing—too fast seems desperate, too slow seems uninterested. You've had fights via message that would have been resolved in sixty seconds face-to-face.</p><p>Your generation delayed marriage longer than any before—not because you don't want partnerships, but because weddings cost the median American salary and you're still paying off student loans that were supposed to be investments. The life script your parents followed—graduate, marry, house, kids by thirty—isn't available at a price anyone can afford. You're improvising a new script.</p><p>Communication for you is asynchronous by default. You maintain friendships through group chats and Instagram comments. You've had relationships across time zones because everyone moves for work now. You know how to be close to people who are far away and distant from people who are near. The pandemic accelerated this—everyone learned what you already knew about building connection through screens.</p><p>You're probably better at digital communication than face-to-face, which is both skill and handicap. You can craft the perfect text but fumble small talk. You've gone on dates that felt like job interviews because you're better at presenting a curated version of yourself than being spontaneous in real-time. Authenticity is harder when you've been performing online since middle school.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were ten when the dot-com bubble burst—abstract at the time, but you absorbed the anxiety from adults. Fourteen during the 2008 financial crisis, watching parents worry about jobs they'd thought were secure, watching neighbors lose homes they'd thought were theirs. Twenty-six during the COVID economic collapse. <span class=\"hero-callout\">You've watched the economy implode three times before turning thirty-five.</span> This has given you a financial worldview best described as 'expecting the floor to drop out at any moment.'</p><p>Your relationship with money is defined by scarcity that started before you had any of your own. You probably graduated with student loan debt that will follow you for decades. You've watched housing prices climb 40% in five years while your wages grew 3%. The math doesn't work. Everyone knows the math doesn't work. Nothing changes.</p><p>You save obsessively or not at all—there's rarely middle ground. Either you're paranoid about the next crash and hoarding cash, or you've decided that since you'll never afford a house anyway, you might as well enjoy what you have now. Both responses make sense given the circumstances. Neither is particularly healthy long-term.</p><p>You've been lectured about lattes and avocado toast by people who bought houses for what you pay in annual rent. The generational wealth gap is the widest it's ever been, and you're on the wrong side. Boomers accumulated assets when they were cheap. You're accumulating debt while assets are expensive. The appreciation they received for existing and holding deeds—you'll never see that.</p><p>Your generation is redefining financial success because the old definitions don't apply to your circumstances. It's not homeownership—it's paying rent in a city you can't afford because that's where the jobs are. It's not retirement at 65—it's working until something breaks. It's not building wealth for your kids—it's hoping you won't become their financial burden. The goalposts moved while you were still running toward them.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest weakness is the same as its greatest strength: you believe everything can be optimized. You track sleep, steps, calories, screen time, productivity scores. You approach self-improvement like a productivity hack with quantifiable metrics. The problem is you can't gamify your way out of systemic collapse. Some problems don't have apps. Some failures aren't personal.</p><p>You're so good at adapting to broken systems that you sometimes forget to question whether the systems should exist at all. You've normalized precarity as a condition of adult life. You've accepted that healthcare depends on employment, that education requires debt, that retirement might never happen. You've learned to cope instead of demanding structural change.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that cost you money and dignity. You were raised on participation trophies and told to be team players and bring solutions not problems. You'll work unpaid overtime for 'experience.' You'll accept 'equity' instead of salary because the CEO made it sound exciting. You'll endure toxic workplaces because the job market is brutal and you need health insurance. You've been trained to accommodate, and employers have noticed.</p><p>You're so steeped in irony that earnestness feels dangerous. You can't just like something—you have to like it ironically, or acknowledge its problematic elements while still enjoying it, or defend your enjoyment preemptively. This protective distance makes it hard to advocate for yourself without hedging. Your emotional armor is also your emotional cage.</p><p>You're so online that you sometimes mistake performance for action. You can mobilize hashtags faster than any generation before. But changing policy requires showing up to boring local meetings that don't generate engagement metrics. You can cancel people on Twitter and feel righteous. Structural change requires sustained, unglamorous work that nobody likes and shares.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (2014-2024):</strong> You came of age in a recovering economy that somehow never felt recovered—corporations posted profits while wages stagnated. You graduated into a job market that demanded experience you couldn't get without jobs that wouldn't hire you without experience. You probably lived with roommates well into your late twenties, moved cities for work or cheaper rent, delayed everything your parents did in their twenties. This was supposed to be your 'exploration' decade. It became your 'survival' decade. You made it work because you had to.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2024-2034):</strong> You're entering this decade now. You're making more money than you did at twenty-five, but costs have outpaced income at every turn. You're supposed to 'settle down,' but settlement requires capital you don't have. This is the decade where people traditionally buy houses, have kids, establish careers. You might do some of these things. You'll probably do them later than your parents did, on shakier financial ground, with less institutional support. The timeline stretched because the economics demanded it.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2034-2044):</strong> This should be your peak earning decade, statistically. You'll probably have more authority at work, more clarity about what matters, more acceptance of what you can't change. Your parents will be aging, which adds responsibilities and costs. If you have kids, they'll be teenagers—expensive, complicated, exhausting. You'll be sandwiched between generations, managing everyone's needs while yours wait. This is the decade where you either double down on the life you've built or realize it's not working and start over.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2044-2054):</strong> By now, you'll have lived through at least four economic crises, likely another pandemic, and countless 'unprecedented' events that happen every few years now. Retirement age keeps moving—it'll probably be seventy by then, if Social Security still exists. You'll be mentoring people who don't remember a pre-smartphone world. You'll be annoyed at how they take things for granted, and annoyed at yourself for becoming that person.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2054+):</strong> Retirement won't look like your parents' retirement—the leisure, the travel, the complete cessation of work. It'll be part-time work, gig economy hustle, or dependence on kids who are struggling themselves. Climate change will have reshaped where people can live. The world will be unrecognizable from the one you grew up in. You'll tell younger people about life before smartphones, before the internet was everywhere, before AI was embedded in everything. They won't believe you. You'll barely believe it yourself.</p>"

Your generation has worse mental health outcomes than any before, measured by every available metric. You're more anxious, more depressed, more medicated. The world you inherited is harder and lonelier than the one promised to you in those optimistic '90s.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more educated, and more aware of injustice than any generation before.
