      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1994-2006</h2><p>You were born the year O.J. Simpson led police on a slow-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, 95 million Americans watching live. Somewhere between the real-time car chase and the courtroom drama that followed, America discovered it could not look away from spectacle. This would define the media landscape of your entire life.</p><p>Your first year coincided with the Rwandan genocide—800,000 people killed in 100 days while the world mostly watched. Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first Black president. Kurt Cobain died. The World Wide Web was being born in research labs, but your parents were still using phone books. Amazon was founded in a garage that July.</p><p>You were four when Google launched, five during Columbine, seven during 9/11. These weren't news stories you read about later—they were the texture of your childhood. You grew up in the shadow of that September morning, watching adults process shock and fear, learning that the world was fragile in ways nobody had warned you about.</p><p>You were the last cohort to have an analog early childhood and a digital adolescence. You probably remember VHS tapes and Saturday morning cartoons before streaming existed. You had a CD player before an iPod. You called friends on landlines, endured dial-up internet sounds, and learned to type on a keyboard before a touchscreen. Then everything accelerated.</p><p>By the time you were twelve, YouTube existed. By fourteen, the iPhone had launched. You didn't grow up with social media—you watched it colonize your life in real-time. MySpace came first, then Facebook, then everything else. You were among the first generation of teenagers to document every awkward moment online.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Millennials</h2><p>You're a Millennial, born between 1981 and 1996—and you're near the tail end, which means you share some DNA with Gen Z. Pew Research draws the line at 1996, so you made the cut by two years. Your generation is roughly 72 million people in the US, making it the largest cohort until Gen Z started catching up.</p><p>The defining moment for Millennials was 9/11. You were seven—old enough to remember it, young enough that it shaped your entire worldview rather than disrupting an existing one. You don't remember a pre-9/11 America. Airport security, forever wars, surveillance culture—that's just how things were.</p><p>Your generation graduated into the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. You were fourteen when Lehman Brothers collapsed, which meant you watched your parents' 401(k)s evaporate and learned, early, that financial security was a fiction. By the time you entered the job market, the damage was done. Entry-level positions required five years of experience. Internships were unpaid. The gig economy wasn't liberation—it was the only option left.</p><p>You've been blamed for killing everything from casual dining to the diamond industry. The joke got old around the time you realized you couldn't afford rent, let alone avocado toast. Millennials are sandwiched between Gen X (who got theirs before the economy collapsed) and Gen Z (who never expected to get anything in the first place). You're optimistic enough to believe things could get better, cynical enough to know they probably won't.</p><p>Being born in 1994 puts you in the micro-generation some call 'Zillennials'—you understand TikTok but remember a time before smartphones. You can code-switch between older Millennials who are nostalgic for the '90s and Gen Z kids who have never known a world without Instagram.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Forrest Gump won Best Picture and The Lion King taught every kid in America that death was inevitable and Elton John would be there to sing about it. Pulp Fiction came out, but you were too young to appreciate Tarantino's non-linear storytelling until you watched it at a sleepover a decade later.</p><p>Musically, 1994 was the year grunge peaked and died. Kurt Cobain's suicide in April made him a martyr. Weezer released their Blue Album. Green Day's Dookie went diamond. Boyz II Men were everywhere. TLC warned about chasing waterfalls. The Notorious B.I.G. dropped Ready to Die. It was a strangely excellent year for music—an inflection point between decades.</p><p>TV in 1994 gave the world Friends, which would define sitcom aesthetics for the next decade and make everyone believe they could afford a massive Manhattan apartment on a barista's salary. ER launched the same night. Ellen premiered. My So-Called Life lasted one perfect season. The Simpsons was at its peak.</p><p>Your childhood was peak Nickelodeon—Rugrats, Hey Arnold!, All That, the orange VHS tapes. You caught the tail end of the Disney Renaissance and the beginning of Pixar's dominance. Your adolescence belonged to MySpace profiles with auto-playing songs, emo music, and the endless debate about Fall Out Boy versus Panic! at the Disco.</p><p>You were thirteen when the first iPhone launched, which means you got a smartphone during your formative years. Your high school experience was documented on Facebook. Your college years were filtered through Instagram. The culture you consumed wasn't broadcast at you—it was something you participated in, remixed, and shared. That shift happened while you were watching.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year Netscape Navigator launched, making the World Wide Web accessible to regular people for the first time. Marc Andreessen was twenty-three and had just built the browser that would start the dot-com boom. The internet was moving from research labs to living rooms, though your family's computer probably ran Windows 3.1 and couldn't go online at all.</p><p>Sony released the PlayStation in Japan your birth year—a console that would define gaming for your generation. CD-ROMs were the future. Floppy disks still existed. Amazon was a bookstore operating out of Jeff Bezos's garage, which in retrospect was like watching a small fire that would eventually burn down everything.</p><p>You were four when Google launched. Six when the dot-com bubble burst. Seven during 9/11, which accelerated surveillance technology and security theater. Ten when Facebook opened to high schools. Twelve when the first iPhone arrived. You watched the smartphone revolution happen during your most formative years.</p><p>This makes you one of the last people to remember life before the internet was everywhere. You know what boredom felt like before screens could fill every empty moment. You remember printing MapQuest directions, going to Blockbuster, waiting a week to see photos you'd taken. You're fluent in both analog and digital.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is intimate and complicated. You're native to social media in ways older Millennials aren't, but you remember life before it in ways Gen Z doesn't. You can troubleshoot your parents' Wi-Fi and explain memes to your older cousins. You're the translator between generations, fluent in both languages.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were two months old when Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's first Black president, ending apartheid. The Rwandan genocide happened that same year—800,000 people murdered in 100 days. Your birth year contained both hope and horror at global scale.</p><p>You were three when the Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people. It was domestic terrorism before anyone used that phrase. You were five when Princess Diana died, and you probably don't remember it, but you remember the adults being upset, the endless funeral coverage, the collective grief performed on television.</p><p>You were seven during 9/11. Second grade. You remember being pulled out of school, or watching the towers fall on the classroom TV, or coming home to parents who looked afraid in ways you'd never seen. Everything after divided into before and after. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq started soon after. You've never known an America not at war somewhere.</p><p>You were ten during Hurricane Katrina. Fourteen when the financial crisis hit. Obama was elected when you were fourteen—the first presidential election you actually paid attention to, the first Black president, 'hope and change' as a slogan before it became ironic.</p><p>You were nineteen during Sandy Hook. Twenty-two when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. Twenty-two when Trump announced his campaign. Twenty-six during COVID-19. You've lived through more destabilizing events by thirty than your grandparents experienced in entire lifetimes.</p><p>The through-line is disruption. Every time stability seemed possible, something shattered it. You've learned to expect crisis, to treat chaos as the baseline. This isn't pessimism—it's pattern recognition.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 2016-2018, depending on your education path. The 2008 financial crisis happened when you were fourteen—you watched older siblings and cousins struggle to find jobs, learned early that a college degree wasn't the golden ticket it used to be. By the time you graduated, the economy had technically recovered, but wages hadn't, and neither had expectations.</p><p>Your generation perfected the 'side hustle' because one job doesn't cover rent, let alone student loans. You've probably driven for Uber, delivered for DoorDash, sold things on Etsy, or monetized some skill on Fiverr. The gig economy isn't liberation—it's filling gaps that full-time employment used to cover.</p><p>You've worked in offices with ping-pong tables and cold brew on tap, performative perks masking the fact that you're salary-exempt and expected to answer Slack at midnight. You've been through rounds of layoffs, watched companies announce record profits while cutting headcount, learned that 'we're a family here' means 'we'll exploit your loyalty.'</p><p>Remote work became normalized because of COVID, which hit when you were in your mid-twenties. You proved you could work from anywhere, which means employers now expect you to work from everywhere. The boundaries between work and life, already blurry, dissolved entirely. Your apartment became your office, your commute became your hallway, and your mental health took the hit.</p><p>You've learned to list 'passion' on resumes because employers want you to care deeply about their mission while paying you barely enough to survive. You've watched younger Gen Z colleagues set firmer boundaries and wondered why you didn't think to do that earlier. You're senior enough now to mentor interns, junior enough to still feel expendable.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You're the generation that grew up with dating apps. Tinder launched when you were eighteen—you didn't adapt to swipe culture, you came of age inside it. For you, meeting people online isn't weird or novel. It's just how things work. Your parents find this baffling. Your Gen Z siblings think it's obvious.</p><p>You've probably had at least one relationship that happened primarily through text messages and DMs. You know the anxiety of read receipts, the calculation of response timing, the semiotics of emoji usage. You've conducted entire romantic negotiations without ever hearing another person's voice.</p><p>Your generation has delayed marriage longer than any before—not because you don't want partnerships, but because weddings cost the median American salary and you're still paying off student loans. The life script your parents followed—graduate, marry, house, kids—isn't available at a price anyone can afford. You're improvising.</p><p>Communication for you is asynchronous by default. You maintain friendships through group chats and Instagram comments. You've had relationships across time zones because everyone moves for work now. You know how to be close to people who are far away and distant from people who are near. The pandemic accelerated this—everyone learned what you already knew about building connection through screens.</p><p>You're better at digital communication than face-to-face, which is both a skill and a handicap. You can craft the perfect text but fumble small talk. You've probably gone on dates that felt like job interviews because you're better at presenting a curated version of yourself than being spontaneous in real-time.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>You were ten when the dot-com bubble burst, fourteen during the 2008 financial crisis, twenty-six during the COVID economic collapse. You've watched the economy implode three times before hitting thirty-five. This has given you a financial worldview best described as 'expecting the floor to drop out at any moment.'</p><p>Your relationship with money is defined by scarcity that started before you had any. You probably graduated with student loan debt that will follow you for decades. You've watched housing prices climb 40% in five years while your wages grew 3%. The math doesn't work. Everyone knows the math doesn't work. Nothing changes.</p><p>You save obsessively or not at all—there's rarely a middle ground. Either you're paranoid about the next crash and hoarding cash, or you've decided that since you'll never afford a house anyway, you might as well enjoy what you have now. Both responses make sense. Neither is healthy.</p><p>You've been lectured about lattes and avocado toast by people who bought houses for what you pay in annual rent. The generational wealth gap is the widest it's ever been, and you're on the wrong side. Boomers accumulated assets when they were cheap. You're accumulating debt while assets are expensive.</p><p>Your generation is redefining financial success because the old definitions don't apply. It's not homeownership—it's paying rent in a city you can't afford because that's where the jobs are. It's not retirement at 65—it's working until something breaks. It's not building wealth for your kids—it's hoping you won't become their financial burden. The goalposts moved. You're running a different race than the one you trained for.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's greatest weakness is the same as its greatest strength: you believe everything can be optimized. You track sleep, steps, calories, screen time. You approach self-improvement like a productivity hack with quantifiable metrics. The problem is you can't gamify your way out of systemic collapse. Some problems don't have an app.</p><p>You're so good at adapting to broken systems that you sometimes forget to question whether the systems should exist at all. You've normalized precarity. You've accepted that healthcare is tied to employment, that education requires debt, that retirement might never happen. You've learned to cope instead of demanding change.</p><p>You're conflict-averse in ways that don't serve you. You were raised on participation trophies and told to be team players. You'll work unpaid overtime for 'experience.' You'll accept 'equity' instead of salary. You'll endure toxic workplaces because the job market is brutal and you need health insurance. You've been trained to accommodate, and people have noticed.</p><p>You're so steeped in irony that earnestness feels dangerous. You can't just like something—you have to like it ironically, or acknowledge its problematic elements while still enjoying it. This protective distance makes it hard to advocate for yourself without hedging, apologizing, or making it a joke. Your emotional armor is also your emotional cage.</p><p>You're so online that you sometimes mistake performance for action. You can mobilize hashtags, but changing policy requires showing up to boring local meetings. You can cancel people on Twitter, but structural change requires sustained, unglamorous work. The dopamine hit of digital activism feels like progress. It usually isn't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (2014-2024):</strong> You came of age in a recovering economy that somehow never felt recovered. You graduated into a job market that demanded experience you couldn't get without jobs that wouldn't hire you without experience. You probably lived with roommates well into your late twenties, moved cities for work or cheaper rent, delayed everything your parents did in their twenties. This was supposed to be your 'exploration' decade. It became your 'survival' decade.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (2024-2034):</strong> You're entering or just entered this decade. You're making more money than you did at twenty-five, but costs have outpaced income. You're supposed to 'settle down,' but settlement requires capital you don't have. This is the decade where people traditionally buy houses, have kids, establish careers. You might do some of these things. You'll probably do them later than your parents did, on shakier financial ground, with less institutional support.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2034-2044):</strong> This should be your peak earning decade, statistically. You'll probably have more authority at work, more clarity about what matters. Your parents will be aging, which adds responsibilities. If you have kids, they'll be teenagers—expensive, complicated, exhausting. You'll be sandwiched between generations, managing everyone's needs. This is the decade where you either double down on the life you've built or realize it's not working and start over.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2044-2054):</strong> By now, you'll have lived through at least four economic crises, likely another pandemic, and countless 'unprecedented' events. Retirement age keeps moving—it'll probably be seventy by then, if Social Security still exists. You'll be mentoring people who don't remember a pre-smartphone world. You'll be annoyed at how they take things for granted, and annoyed at yourself for becoming that person.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2054+):</strong> Retirement won't look like your parents' retirement—golf courses and early-bird dinners. It'll be part-time work, gig economy hustle, or dependence on kids who are struggling themselves. Climate change will have reshaped where people can live. The world will be unrecognizable from the one you grew up in. You'll tell younger people about life before smartphones, before the internet was everywhere. They won't believe you. You'll barely believe it yourself.</p>"

    "comparison": {
      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 4 million people born in 1994. The entire Millennial generation is about 72 million people in the US. You're on the younger end, which means you share some characteristics with Gen Z while remaining distinctly Millennial.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're more educated, more diverse, and significantly poorer adjusted for age. Gen X entered the workforce when the economy functioned. You entered after it broke. They got affordable college. You got crushing debt. They got pensions. You got 401(k)s that crater every time the market sneezes. They got stability. You got the gig economy and 'disruption.'</p><p>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964), the wealth gap is obscene. Boomers controlled about 21% of the nation's wealth when they were your age. Millennials control around 7%. Boomers bought houses for one or two years' salary. You're spending a year's salary on rent. Boomers had defined-benefit pensions. You're hoping Social Security survives long enough for you to collect anything.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're similar but slightly more optimistic—or maybe just more naive. You remember a time before everything felt broken. Gen Z doesn't. You believed the system could be reformed. Gen Z is building alternatives because they've already given up on reform. You adapted to smartphones; they were born holding them.</p><p>Your life expectancy is projected at 76-79 years, slightly lower than previous generations due to rising 'deaths of despair'—suicide, drugs, alcohol. Your generation has worse mental health outcomes than any before. You're more anxious, more depressed, more medicated. The world you inherited is harder and lonelier than the one promised to you.</p><p>But you're also more tolerant, more educated, and more aware of injustice than any generation before. You've normalized therapy, destigmatized mental health, pushed for equity your parents' generation didn't acknowledge. You've made the world more inclusive even as it's become less affordable. That matters, even when it doesn't feel like enough.</p>"
