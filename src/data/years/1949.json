      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1949-1961</h2><p>You arrived the year George Orwell warned everyone about 1984, which means you've had thirty-five extra years to watch his predictions come true. NATO formed that April. Mao declared the People's Republic of China that October. The Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb that August. Your birth announcement competed with headlines about the end of America's nuclear monopoly.</p><p>Your childhood was postwar prosperity wrapped in Cold War paranoia. Fathers came home from the war, moved to the suburbs, and had kids at an unprecedented rate—you were part of the largest baby boom in American history. Your family probably moved into a tract house that looked exactly like every other house on the block. Levittown wasn't a joke yet. It was the American Dream made affordable.</p><p>You were five when Brown v. Board of Education declared segregation unconstitutional, though it would take years for that ruling to mean anything in practice. You were six when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. Eight when Little Rock erupted. The civil rights movement wasn't something you learned about in history class—it was happening on your television while you ate dinner.</p><p>Duck-and-cover drills were a normal part of elementary school. You learned to hide under your desk in case the Soviets dropped a bomb, which seems absurd now but felt real then. The Rosenbergs were executed the year you turned four. McCarthy's hearings played on television. The communist threat was everywhere, even if you were too young to understand exactly what communism was.</p><p>Television itself was still new. Your family might have gotten their first set in the early 1950s, and you'd gather around it like it was a miracle—which it was. Howdy Doody, I Love Lucy, The Lone Ranger. Three channels, if you were lucky. Rabbit ears that needed constant adjustment. A test pattern at midnight because nothing was on.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>You're a Baby Boomer, born between 1946 and 1964. That's roughly 76 million people in the US—the generation that remade American culture in its image and then complained about everyone who came after. You're on the older end of the boom, sometimes called the 'Leading-Edge Boomers' or 'Early Boomers,' which means you were old enough to actually remember the 1960s.</p><p>The defining feature of your generation is sheer size. There were simply more of you than anyone knew what to do with. Schools couldn't be built fast enough. Jobs materialized because employers needed workers. Social Security was solvent because your generation was paying into it. Being numerous was a form of power.</p><p>You came of age during the 1960s, which means you remember exactly where you were when JFK was shot. You watched the moon landing live. You either went to Vietnam or knew people who did. The draft wasn't theoretical—it was a number in a lottery that could upend your life.</p><p>Your generation invented the counterculture and then abandoned it. You protested the war, then voted for Reagan. You preached free love, then moved to the suburbs and worried about property values. The contradictions aren't hypocrisy, exactly—they're just what happens when an entire generation grows up. Idealism is easier at twenty than at fifty.</p><p>Boomers are often blamed for everything wrong with America: the housing crisis, the wealth gap, the climate crisis, the political polarization. Some of this is fair. A lot of it is just younger generations needing someone to blame for inheriting a mess. You didn't personally cause the 2008 financial crisis. You were just alive while it happened, which apparently makes it your fault.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman won the Pulitzer Prize, which was prescient given how much of American culture would be devoted to selling you things. Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific opened on Broadway. Gene Autry released 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' which you've now heard approximately forty thousand times.</p><p>Your childhood was the golden age of radio transitioning to the golden age of television. You grew up with The Ed Sullivan Show, which introduced America to everything from Elvis to the Beatles. You watched Westerns—Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Have Gun Will Travel—when America was still pretending the frontier was noble instead of genocidal.</p><p>Rock and roll arrived when you were five or six. You were the perfect age for it. Elvis on Ed Sullivan in 1956. Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard. Your parents were horrified. You were transformed. Music would never sound the same.</p><p>By the time you hit high school, it was the early 1960s. The Beach Boys, the girl groups, Motown. You were seventeen when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan. Eighteen when the British Invasion hit full force. Twenty during the Summer of Love. Your teenage years had possibly the greatest soundtrack in American history.</p><p>Movies followed a similar arc. You grew up with Disney animation and Biblical epics. You came of age with Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Easy Rider—films that broke every rule your childhood movies followed. You watched American cinema grow up alongside you, getting darker, more honest, more complicated.</p><p>By your thirties, you were watching M*A*S*H, All in the Family, Saturday Night Live. By your forties, it was Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues. You've seen television evolve from three channels of wholesome nonsense to prestige dramas that require spreadsheets to follow. You've lived through every era of American pop culture because you've been alive for most of American pop culture.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born before computers existed in any meaningful sense. ENIAC had only been running for three years. The transistor was invented in 1947, two years before you. The technology that would define the modern world was still being invented in laboratories while you learned to walk.</p><p>Your childhood was analog in ways that are hard to explain to anyone born after 1980. Television was black and white until you were about fifteen. Telephones had dials, then buttons. Long-distance calls were expensive enough that you planned them. Air conditioning was a luxury. Jet travel was new and glamorous.</p><p>You were twenty when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. Humanity went from the Wright Brothers to the lunar surface in sixty-six years, and you were alive for most of that progression. Space wasn't science fiction—it was the evening news.</p><p>Personal computers arrived when you were in your thirties. The Apple II came out in 1977. The IBM PC in 1981. You might have been an early adopter, or you might have ignored them entirely—plenty of people did. By the time computers became essential, you were already established in your career. You adapted, but you didn't grow up with them the way younger generations did.</p><p>The internet became mainstream when you were in your mid-forties. Email replaced memos. Websites replaced catalogs. You learned to use Google, which was quite useful, and you learned to use Facebook, which was somewhat useful, and you learned to use smartphones, which are both essential and somehow annoying.</p><p>You've witnessed more technological change than any generation in human history. You were born into a world of rotary phones and propeller planes. You're living in a world of smartphones and reusable rockets. The gulf between your childhood technology and your current technology is almost incomprehensible. No generation before you experienced anything close to this, and no generation after you will find it as disorienting.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were four when the Korean War ended. Nine when Sputnik launched and America panicked about falling behind the Soviets. Eleven when the U-2 incident torpedoed Eisenhower's peace summit. Thirteen when the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world closer to nuclear annihilation than it's ever been. You grew up with apocalypse as a plausible outcome.</p><p>You were fourteen when JFK was assassinated. You remember exactly where you were—everyone your age does. It was November 22, 1963, and the world split into before and after. You were nineteen when MLK and RFK were killed, two months apart. The 1960s felt like the country was coming apart, because it was.</p><p>Vietnam was the defining conflict of your young adulthood. You were sixteen when the Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed. Eighteen when the draft lottery started. The war didn't end until you were twenty-six. If you're male, you either served, got a deferment, or spent years worrying about which it would be. Either way, it marked you.</p><p>You were twenty when the moon landing happened. Twenty-four during Watergate. Thirty during the Iranian hostage crisis. Thirty-six when the Challenger exploded. Forty when the Berlin Wall fell—the enemy you'd been trained to fear since childhood suddenly vanishing overnight.</p><p>You were fifty-two during 9/11, old enough to have perspective on tragedy but still shaken by it. Fifty-nine during the 2008 financial crisis, which probably hit your retirement savings. Seventy-one during COVID-19, which made you a member of the most vulnerable demographic.</p><p>You've lived through the entire arc of American global dominance—from postwar triumph through Cold War anxiety through unipolar supremacy through whatever this current era is called. You've seen enemies become allies and allies become complications. You've watched the American Century rise and start to decline, all within your lifetime.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce in the late 1960s or early 1970s, depending on your education. The economy was strong. Jobs were available. A high school diploma could get you a solid middle-class career with a pension. A college degree was almost a guarantee of professional success, and it didn't require mortgaging your future to obtain.</p><p>Your generation invented the workaholic. You believed in loyalty to employers, climbing the corporate ladder, putting in the hours. Work wasn't just a paycheck—it was identity. You measured yourself by your career progress in ways that mystify younger generations who've been burned too many times to invest that much meaning in a job.</p><p>You probably had one or two employers for most of your career, which is impossible to explain to anyone who entered the workforce after 2000. Companies offered job security, pensions, healthcare, the implicit promise that loyalty would be rewarded. Some of that promise was kept. Much of it evaporated when corporate America discovered shareholder value.</p><p>You witnessed the transformation of the American workplace. When you started, secretaries typed on typewriters and offices ran on paper. By the time you retired (or are planning to retire), everything was digital, remote work was possible, and the secretary pool had been replaced by everyone doing their own typing. You adapted to more workplace revolutions than any generation before you.</p><p>If you're a woman, your career was constrained by sexism that's hard to convey to anyone who didn't live it. Help wanted ads were segregated by gender until 1973. Sexual harassment wasn't illegal until 1986. The glass ceiling was very real, and breaking through it required fighting battles that younger women often don't realize were fought.</p><p>You're either retired now or approaching retirement, which means navigating a system that's much less generous than the one your parents enjoyed. Pensions have been replaced by 401(k)s. Social Security is adequate but not comfortable. The retirement your generation was promised is different from the retirement your generation received.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which was either liberating or terrifying depending on your temperament and circumstances. The Pill was approved in 1960, when you were eleven. By the time you were dating seriously, contraception had transformed the stakes. So had feminism, which arrived in your twenties and changed expectations about marriage, family, and partnership.</p><p>You probably married younger than subsequent generations—the average age at first marriage in the early 1970s was about 21 for women and 23 for men. If that marriage ended in divorce (and roughly half of first marriages in your cohort did), you might have remarried. Blended families became normal because your generation normalized them.</p><p>Communication technology during your dating years was letters, landlines, and in-person conversation. Long-distance relationships required effort—actual written correspondence, expensive phone calls, careful planning. You couldn't text someone you liked. You had to call their house and risk their father answering.</p><p>Your generation invented modern dating norms and then watched them be replaced by apps. You went from drive-in movies and milkshakes to whatever Tinder is. You raised children who meet romantic partners on their phones, which probably seems both convenient and slightly dystopian.</p><p>Friendship in your generation was geography-dependent. Your friends were people you saw regularly—neighbors, coworkers, church members. When people moved away, friendships often faded because maintaining them required effort that felt insurmountable. Long-distance friendship wasn't impossible, but it wasn't easy either.</p><p>Now you have grandchildren (probably) and you're navigating how to stay connected across generations. FaceTime exists, which helps. Group texts exist, which help differently. You've learned to communicate through technology you didn't grow up with, which is an accomplishment that often goes unacknowledged.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your relationship with money was shaped by parents who lived through the Great Depression. You inherited their caution, their savings habits, their suspicion of debt. Buy what you can afford. Save for emergencies. Don't trust that prosperity will last, because your parents watched it vanish overnight.</p><p>But you also grew up during unprecedented prosperity. The postwar boom was real. Jobs paid well. Houses were affordable. A single income could support a family. You could work your way through college without loans. The gap between your parents' scarcity mentality and your own abundant reality created a complicated psychology.</p><p>You bought houses when houses were cheap, which is the single biggest factor in your generation's wealth accumulation. The median home price in 1970 was about $23,000—roughly three times the median household income. That same ratio today would mean houses cost about $200,000. They don't. The assets you purchased appreciate while younger generations watch from the sidelines.</p><p>You trusted the stock market, generally, and that trust was rewarded, generally. You rode the 1980s and 1990s bull markets. You survived the dot-com crash and the 2008 crisis, though both probably dented your portfolios. If you stayed invested, you recovered. Time was on your side in ways it isn't for people starting later.</p><p>Social Security and Medicare exist because your generation votes in large numbers. Politicians protect programs that benefit you because crossing seniors is political suicide. Younger generations resent this, not entirely without reason. The programs you rely on are less certain to exist for them.</p><p>Your generation holds more wealth than any generation in American history, which is both an accomplishment and a source of intergenerational tension. You didn't steal that wealth—you worked for it, saved it, benefited from timing and policies that favored asset accumulation. But the playing field wasn't level, and pretending it was doesn't help anyone.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your generation's biggest blind spot is not recognizing how much the world has changed since you were young. The economy that rewarded your hard work doesn't exist anymore. The housing market you navigated was fundamentally different. The job market you entered bore no resemblance to the one younger people face. Advice that was sensible in 1975 is often useless in 2025.</p><p>You tend to underestimate how much systemic advantages helped you and overestimate how much individual effort explained your success. The GI Bill, affordable housing, strong unions, employer loyalty, pensions, regulated finance—these weren't natural features of the economy. They were policy choices that benefited your generation specifically. When those policies changed, outcomes changed.</p><p>Your generation can be dismissive of mental health struggles in ways that cause real harm. Depression was weakness. Anxiety was worry. Trauma was something you got over. The stoicism that helped your parents survive the Depression and World War II became, in your generation, a resistance to emotional vulnerability that younger people experience as coldness.</p><p>Technology bewilders you more than you'd like to admit. You've adapted—you have a smartphone, you use the internet—but the intuition isn't there. You still think of the digital world as separate from the real world, which it isn't. You still print emails. You still worry about computer viruses in ways that made sense in 2005 but are slightly off now.</p><p>You sometimes confuse your experience with universal truth. 'I worked my way through college' ignores that tuition has increased 1,200% since 1980. 'I bought a house at 25' ignores that housing costs have outpaced wages for decades. 'I stayed with one employer for 30 years' ignores that employers stopped offering that deal. Your experience was real, but it's not replicable.</p><p>Climate change is the blind spot that will define your generation's legacy. You were adults when the science became clear. You had political and economic power to address it. Meaningful action didn't happen. Your grandchildren will inherit a different planet than the one you grew up on, and they will have questions about why.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1969-1979):</strong> You came of age during Vietnam, Watergate, and the end of postwar optimism. This was supposed to be your idealistic decade, and for many of you, it was—civil rights, feminism, environmentalism, the whole countercultural sweep. You also got jobs, married young (by later standards), started families. The economy was strong until the oil crisis. Then stagflation. Your twenties ended with disco, malaise, and the Iranian hostage crisis.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1979-1989):</strong> Reagan's America. You settled into careers, raised children, moved to suburbs. The counterculture gave way to conservatism—or you held onto your principles while the culture moved right. AIDS emerged and terrified everyone. The Cold War remained frozen. Wall Street boomed. Yuppies were invented. Your thirties were the decade of Morning in America, whether you bought the slogan or not.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1989-1999):</strong> The Cold War ended. The Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. The existential threat you'd grown up with vanished almost overnight. The 90s brought the Clinton boom, the internet, globalization's promises. Your kids became teenagers. Your parents started aging. You were firmly middle-aged, with all the responsibilities that implies.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (1999-2009):</strong> You entered this decade at the peak of American triumphalism—the Cold War won, the economy booming, the future looking prosperous. Then came 9/11, which changed everything. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The housing bubble inflating and then exploding. By 2008, your retirement savings had probably taken a serious hit. Your fifties began in optimism and ended in crisis.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2009-2019):</strong> Recovery from the financial crisis, though perhaps not full recovery. You either retired or started planning for it seriously. Grandchildren arrived (for many of you). Your health became something you thought about more than you used to. Politics grew more polarized. The world your grandchildren inhabited seemed increasingly foreign—all screens and anxiety and climate news.</p><p><strong>Your 70s (2019-2029):</strong> You're in this decade now, or about to be. COVID-19 put you in the vulnerable category. The world changed again, as it keeps doing. You're navigating late life in a country that sometimes feels unrecognizable from the one you grew up in. Your generation still votes, still matters politically, still holds wealth and power. The question is what you do with it—and how you're remembered when you're gone.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>You're part of a birth cohort of roughly 3.6 million people born in 1949. The entire Baby Boomer generation is about 76 million people in the US, which made you the largest generation in American history until Millennials caught up. Your cohort dominated American culture for decades simply through demographic weight.</p><p>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), you were louder, more numerous, and more disruptive. They grew up during the Depression and World War II, which made them cautious and conformist. You grew up during prosperity, which made you confident enough to question everything they'd accepted. You were the generation that said 'don't trust anyone over 30,' then turned 30 and expected to be trusted.</p><p>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980), you're larger and wealthier. Gen X was the 'baby bust'—a smaller cohort that followed your boom. They grew up in your shadow, competing for resources you'd already claimed. They're sometimes called the forgotten generation, sandwiched between Boomers who won't retire and Millennials who complain more loudly.</p><p>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996), you had every economic advantage. You bought houses when they were cheap. You got pensions instead of 401(k)s. You graduated without debt. Millennials entered the workforce during the Great Recession you caused (or at least failed to prevent). The intergenerational resentment is real and, frankly, somewhat justified.</p><p>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012), you're from different planets. They don't remember a world before smartphones. They've never known economic security. Climate change isn't an abstract future threat to them—it's the water they swim in. You have grandchildren their age. The gap between your childhood and theirs is almost incomprehensible.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 68 years. If you've made it to 75, you can expect to live into your mid-80s. Medical advances have extended your life, though they've also extended the period of decline. You'll probably spend more years in retirement than your parents did, which is a mixed blessing—more time, but more expensive time.</p><p>Your generation's legacy is complicated. You changed the world—civil rights, feminism, environmentalism, technology. You also accumulated wealth while pulling up ladders, ignored climate warnings, and presided over rising inequality. History will judge you, as it judges every generation. The verdict isn't in yet.</p>"
