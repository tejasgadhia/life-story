The weight of a cap gun in this cohort's hand, the sulfur smoke after pulling the trigger. This cohort's childhood had a texture that kids today will never know—everything was tactile, imaginative, real.</p><p>At five, this cohort was glued to Howdy Doody, watching Buffalo Bob Smith ask 'Hey kids, what time is it?' This cohort knew the answer by heart. The Lone Ranger crackled from the radio before it moved to television. Captain Video and His Video Rangers. Kukla, Fran and Ollie. This cohort begged this cohort's parents to let this cohort stay up for I Love Lucy, which premiered when this cohort was two and became the show everyone talked about at school.</p><p>This cohort's toys were simpler but somehow more alive. Lincoln Logs and Erector Sets that actually required building something. Tinker Toys. Roy Rogers cap guns and cowboy outfits because everyone wanted to be a cowboy. Betsy Wetsy dolls that actually wet their diapers—a technological marvel. This cohort played marbles on the sidewalk, kept score, and traded them like currency.</p><p>Dinner came from cans that felt modern. Campbell's soup—this cohort knew the red and white label before this cohort could read. Swanson TV dinners arrived when this cohort was five, aluminum trays with compartments that kept the turkey away from the peas. Spam was still considered acceptable protein. Jell-O molds at every church potluck, often with fruit suspended inside like prehistoric insects in amber.</p><p>At six, this cohort practiced duck-and-cover drills, crawling under this cohort's wooden desk as if it could stop an atomic bomb. The Rosenbergs were executed when this cohort was four. McCarthy's hearings played on the television this cohort's family gathered around like a shrine. The communists were everywhere, this cohort's teachers said—in Hollywood, in the State Department, maybe even in this cohort's neighborhood. This cohort didn't fully understand the threat, but this cohort understood fear.</p><p>At eight, this cohort watched the Little Rock Nine on television—nine Black students walking through a mob of screaming white adults just to go to school. This cohort were old enough to understand injustice, even if the adults around this cohort pretended it was more complicated than it was.</p>"

Boomers're part of the <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans born between 1946 and 1964—the generation so large it reshaped every institution it touched. Schools, jobs, housing, culture: all bent around this generation's sheer numbers. Boomers're an early Boomer, born in the first wave, which means this generation was old enough to actually remember the sixties. Not the nostalgia version. The real thing.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Boomers was fourteen when JFK was assassinated. November 22, 1963. Boomers remember exactly where this generation was—everyone this generation's age does.</span> Eighth grade, probably. A teacher crying. The principal's announcement. The walk home feeling like the world had cracked open. Everything before that day was innocence. Everything after was something else.</p><p>This generation's generation spans 1946 to 1964—the largest demographic wave in American history until the Millennials caught up. Boomers overwhelmed schools in the fifties, flooded colleges in the sixties, dominated workplaces in the seventies. Wherever this generation went, infrastructure struggled to accommodate this generation. Being numerous was a form of power this generation rarely acknowledged.</p><p>Boomers was twenty during the Summer of Love. Old enough to participate, young enough to believe it meant something. Free love, peace signs, flower power—and also the draft lottery, body counts on the evening news, friends who came back different or didn't come back at all. The sixties weren't just tie-dye and Woodstock. They were also Birmingham and Tet and My Lai.</p><p>This generation's generation gets blamed for everything now: the housing crisis, the climate crisis, the wealth gap, the political polarization. Some of it is fair. Boomers did pull up ladders. Boomers did ignore warnings. But this generation also marched for civil rights, protested an unjust war, and pushed for equality in ways this generation's parents never imagined. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The contradiction is that this generation did both—changed the world and then protected this generation's piece of it.</span> <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this generation was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span></p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Gene Autry's 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' came out the year this cohort was born. This cohort've heard it approximately forty thousand times since. Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman won the Pulitzer that year—prescient, given how much of this cohort's life would be shaped by the American Dream and its discontents. Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific taught America to be 'carefully taught,' even if the lesson didn't stick.</p><p>This cohort's childhood soundtrack was the transition from radio to television. At four, this cohort listened to The Lone Ranger on the radio with this cohort's father. At seven, this cohort watched it on the new TV set in the living room—the one the whole neighborhood came to see. Howdy Doody. The Mickey Mouse Club. Ding Dong School for the little kids, Davy Crockett for everyone. This cohort wanted a coonskin cap. Everyone wanted a coonskin cap.</p><p>At seven, rock and roll arrived like a bomb. Bill Haley's 'Rock Around the Clock' in 1954. Then Elvis on Ed Sullivan when this cohort was seven—this cohort's parents horrified, this cohort transformed. Little Richard screaming 'Tutti Frutti.' Chuck Berry duck-walking across the stage. Buddy Holly with those glasses. The sound split generations in half, and this cohort was on the right side of the divide.</p><p>By high school, it was the early sixties. This cohort were fifteen when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan—February 9, 1964. Seventy-three million people watching. This cohort were sixteen during the British Invasion: the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks. This cohort were eighteen during the Summer of Love, twenty when the White Album dropped, twenty when they played on the rooftop. This cohort's teenage years had the greatest soundtrack in American history, and this cohort knew it even then.</p><p>Movies grew up with this cohort. This cohort saw Bambi and Cinderella as a kid, Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur as a teenager. Then Bonnie and Clyde when this cohort was eighteen—violence and sex that would have been unthinkable five years earlier. The Graduate at eighteen, Easy Rider at twenty. American cinema went from wholesome to subversive in the time it took this cohort to get a driver's license.</p><p>By this cohort's thirties, this cohort was watching All in the Family and M*A*S*H—shows that took the idealism this cohort'd felt at twenty and gave it a bitter, knowing edge. By this cohort's forties, Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice. This cohort've watched television evolve from three channels of innocence to five hundred channels of prestige nihilism. This cohort were there for all of it.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>This cohort's Technology Timeline</h2><p>The rotary dial on this cohort's parents' telephone—that satisfying resistance, the whir as it spun back. The party line this cohort shared with neighbors, where this cohort could pick up and hear Mrs. Henderson gossiping if this cohort was quiet enough. The operator who connected long-distance calls, which cost so much this cohort's parents timed them with a kitchen timer. This was communication when this cohort was five.</p><p>At six, this cohort's family probably got their first television set—a hulking wooden cabinet with a tiny screen and rabbit ears that needed constant adjustment. This cohort watched test patterns while waiting for actual programming to start. This cohort adjusted the vertical hold. This cohort learned that banging the side of the cabinet sometimes fixed the picture. Three channels, maybe, if the weather was right. Black and white until this cohort was fifteen, when color arrived like a revelation.</p><p>At eight, Sputnik blinked across the night sky, and America panicked. The Space Race became the national obsession of this cohort's adolescence. This cohort were twenty when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon—July 20, 1969. This cohort watched it live, grainy footage beamed from a quarter-million miles away, and it felt like the future had finally arrived. Humanity went from Kitty Hawk to the lunar surface in sixty-six years. This cohort were alive for most of that progression.</p><p>At twenty-eight, the Apple II appeared. At thirty-two, the IBM PC. Computers were curiosities, then tools, then inescapable. This cohort might have been an early adopter, bringing a PC into this cohort's office when colleagues thought this cohort was eccentric. Or this cohort might have resisted until resistance became impossible. Either way, this cohort learned to type on a keyboard after decades of secretaries handling that task.</p><p>At forty-six, the World Wide Web arrived. At fifty-five, Google. At fifty-eight, Facebook. At fifty-eight, the iPhone. Each wave of technology required adaptation that younger people never had to consciously make. This cohort remember when 'online' was a place this cohort went, not a state of being. This cohort remember when 'phone' meant a device attached to a wall.</p><p>The gulf between this cohort's childhood technology and now is almost incomprehensible. This cohort were born into rotary phones and propeller planes. This cohort're living with smartphones and SpaceX. No generation before this cohort experienced this much change, and no generation after will find it as disorienting. This cohort're the last people alive who remember what the world was like before.</p>"

This cohort were eight years old.</span> Suddenly the Soviets were in space, beeping overhead, while America scrambled to catch up. The adults were frightened in a way this cohort hadn't seen before—not even during the duck-and-cover drills. This fear was different. This fear was about falling behind.</p><p>At thirteen, the Cuban Missile Crisis. October 1962. Thirteen days when nuclear war felt not just possible but probable. This cohort were old enough to understand what the grown-ups were whispering about. Old enough to feel the fear. This cohort's family might have stocked the basement with canned goods. Some of this cohort's classmates' families built fallout shelters. The world almost ended, and this cohort knew it.</p><p>At fourteen, JFK was shot—this cohort's generation's defining moment, detailed in the generational identity section. The shock waves from that November day shaped everything that followed: escalating Vietnam, the counterculture, the collapse of institutional trust.</p><p>At nineteen, MLK was assassinated. April 4, 1968. Two months later, RFK. The sixties were supposed to be about hope, but by 1968, hope was being gunned down in Memphis and Los Angeles. Cities burned. The Democratic Convention in Chicago became a police riot. This cohort were twenty, draft-eligible, watching the country tear itself apart.</p><p>Vietnam defined this cohort's young adulthood. This cohort were sixteen when the Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed. Nineteen when the draft lottery started. Twenty-six when Saigon fell. <span class=\"pull-quote\">If this cohort're male, this cohort either served, got a deferment, fled to Canada, or spent years with that lottery number hanging over this cohort's life.</span> This cohort knew people who didn't come back. This cohort knew people who came back different. The war shaped this cohort even if this cohort never went.</p><p>At twenty, this cohort watched men walk on the moon. At twenty-four, this cohort watched a president resign. At forty, this cohort watched the Berlin Wall fall—the enemy this cohort'd been trained to fear since childhood suddenly vanishing. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, this cohort was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> At seventy-one, a pandemic made this cohort the vulnerable demographic.

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>Let's talk about what the economy looked like when this cohort entered it. Not the nostalgia version—the actual numbers.</p><p>This cohort graduated college around 1971, if this cohort went. The unemployment rate was 6%. Not great, but manageable. More importantly, a college degree actually meant something—roughly 11% of Americans had one, so this cohort was rare, valuable. A high school diploma alone could get this cohort a union job at a factory that paid enough to buy a house and support a family. The implicit bargain was clear: work hard, stay loyal, and the company would take care of this cohort. For many of this cohort, they did.</p><p>This cohort probably had two or three employers across this cohort's entire career. Maybe just one. This cohort stayed because loyalty was rewarded with pensions, promotions, job security. The company Christmas party had an open bar. The gold watch at retirement wasn't a joke—it was a ritual. Try explaining this to a Millennial who's had four jobs in six years because that's the only way to get a raise.</p><p>If this cohort're a woman, this cohort's career was constrained by barriers that are hard to explain to anyone who didn't live them. Help wanted ads were legally segregated by gender until 1973—this cohort was twenty-four before that changed. Sexual harassment wasn't legally recognized until 1986. The glass ceiling wasn't a metaphor; it was architecture. Every promotion required fighting battles that younger women often don't realize were fought.</p><p>The workplace transformed around this cohort more than any generation before. This cohort started with typewriters, carbon copies, secretarial pools. This cohort ended with email, spreadsheets, everyone doing their own typing. This cohort learned to use computers in this cohort's forties, smartphones in this cohort's sixties. Adapting wasn't optional—it was survival.</p><p>The pension promises started breaking in the eighties. Corporate raiders. Hostile takeovers. Shareholder value. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The implicit contract between employer and employee—loyalty for security—was shredded by people who'd never built anything, only extracted.</span> This cohort watched it happen, helpless to stop it, often benefiting from the short-term gains while the long-term costs were deferred to younger workers. <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and this cohort watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span></p><p>This cohort're retired now, or approaching it. Social Security exists because this cohort's generation votes. Medicare exists because crossing seniors is political suicide. These programs are less certain for those who follow, which they resent—not entirely without reason.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Did this generation ever call a girl's house and hang up when her father answered? Did this generation ever drive past someone's house just to see if their car was there? Did this generation ever wait by the phone—the one phone, attached to the wall—hoping they'd call? Romance before technology was physical, nerve-wracking, and required courage that swiping right will never demand.</p><p>The Pill was approved when this generation was eleven. By the time this generation was dating seriously, contraception had rewritten the rules—but not evenly. The sexual revolution was more revolutionary for some than others. Women this generation's age navigated a narrow path between 'prude' and 'loose,' judged for both extremes. Men had more freedom, as men generally did. The double standard didn't disappear; it just got more complicated.</p><p>Boomers probably married younger than any generation since. The median age for first marriage in 1970 was twenty-one for women, twenty-three for men. Boomers got married before this generation knew who this generation was, which is why roughly half of this generation's generation's first marriages ended in divorce. Boomers normalized blended families because this generation had to. Step-parents, half-siblings, complicated holiday logistics—this generation's generation invented the modern family, for better and worse.</p><p>Courtship meant drive-in movies and milkshakes. Going steady meant his class ring on a chain around this generation's neck. Long-distance relationships required actual letters, written by hand, sent through the mail, received days later. Boomers waited for the mailman the way this generation's grandchildren wait for text notifications. The anticipation was exquisite, and nothing digital has quite replicated it.</p><p>This generation's friendships were bound by geography. This generation's friends were people this generation saw regularly—neighbors, coworkers, church members, bowling league teammates. When someone moved away, the friendship often faded because maintaining it required effort that felt insurmountable: expensive long-distance calls, letters that needed writing, visits that needed planning. Boomers lost touch with people in ways that seem impossible now.</p><p>Boomers have grandchildren, probably. Great-grandchildren, possibly. Boomers've learned to FaceTime, to text, to navigate group chats where three generations communicate in the same thread. Boomers've adapted to technology this generation never imagined, staying connected across distances that would have meant goodbye in this generation's youth. The adaptation often goes unacknowledged, but it's remarkable.</p>"

They remembered when prosperity wasn't a birthright but a fragile gift that could be snatched away. <span class=\"pull-quote\">This cohort inherited their caution—the coffee cans of cash hidden in the basement, the suspicion of debt, the belief that this cohort should always be ready for the floor to drop out.</span></p><p>But this cohort also grew up during the greatest economic expansion in American history. The postwar boom wasn't propaganda; it was this cohort's lived experience. A single income could support a family of four, a house, a car, a vacation. This cohort's father's factory job came with a pension, health insurance, and the expectation that loyalty would be rewarded with security. The cognitive dissonance between this cohort's parents' Depression-era fear and this cohort's own abundant reality created a complicated psychology.</p><p>The numbers tell the story of this cohort's advantage. The median home price in 1970 was <span class=\"stat-box\">$23,000</span>—about three times the median household income. <span class=\"hero-callout\">This cohort could buy a house on a middle-class salary, pay it off in fifteen years, watch it appreciate 400% while this cohort slept.</span> Today that same ratio would mean houses cost $200,000. They don't. They cost <span class=\"stat-box\">$400,000</span>, $500,000, more. The math that worked for this cohort doesn't work anymore.</p><p>This cohort rode the great bull markets: the 1980s, the 1990s, the post-2008 recovery. This cohort survived the crashes too—1987, 2000, 2008—but if this cohort stayed invested, this cohort recovered. Time was on this cohort's side in ways it isn't for people starting later. Compound interest requires decades. This cohort had them.</p><p>This cohort's generation holds more wealth than any in American history—the comparison section details the staggering gap. This isn't because younger generations work less hard. It's because assets appreciated before they could buy them, wages stagnated while costs climbed, and the policies that helped this cohort—affordable education, strong unions, defined-benefit pensions—were dismantled.</p><p>The intergenerational tension is real, and it's not entirely unfair. This cohort didn't steal this cohort's wealth. This cohort worked for it, saved it, benefited from timing this cohort didn't control. But the playing field wasn't level. Acknowledging that costs this cohort nothing and might matter more than this cohort think.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>This generation's Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>This generation's lived experience has become a lens that distorts the present. The economy that rewarded this generation's hard work doesn't exist anymore. The housing market this generation navigated was fundamentally different. The job market this generation entered bears no resemblance to what younger people face. This generation's experience was real, but it's not replicable. The advice this generation offer, however well-intentioned, describes a world that ended decades ago.</p><p>Boomers tend to underestimate how much systemic advantages shaped this generation's success. The GI Bill sent this generation's generation to college on the government's dime—but not Black veterans, who were systematically excluded. Affordable housing existed because redlining and racial covenants concentrated investment in white neighborhoods. Strong unions protected this generation's wages while excluding minorities from membership. The prosperity this generation remember wasn't universal; it was rationed. Acknowledging this doesn't diminish this generation's work. It contextualizes it.</p><p>Mental health carries a stigma this generation might not realize this generation're perpetuating. Depression was weakness. Anxiety was worry. Trauma was something this generation got over, not something this generation processed. The stoicism that helped this generation's parents survive the Depression and World War II calcified, in this generation's generation, into a resistance to emotional vulnerability. When this generation's grandchildren talk about therapy, about boundaries, about mental health days, the eye-roll might be imperceptible—but they notice it.</p><p>Technology bewilders this generation more than this generation'd like to admit. Boomers've adapted, yes—this generation have a smartphone, this generation use email—but the intuition isn't there. Boomers still print emails. Boomers still fall for phishing scams at higher rates than any other demographic. Boomers still think of the digital world as separate from the real world, which it hasn't been for decades. The internet isn't a place this generation visit; it's the infrastructure of modern life.</p><p>Climate change is the blind spot that will define this generation's generation's legacy. Boomers were adults when the science became clear—the first comprehensive climate report was published in 1979, when this generation was thirty. Boomers had political and economic power to address it. Meaningful action didn't happen. This generation's grandchildren will inherit a different planet, and they will have questions. The answers—'we didn't know,' 'it was complicated,' 'someone else's job'—won't satisfy them. They shouldn't.</p><p>The deepest blind spot may be this: this generation think this generation earned everything this generation have, and this generation did—but on a playing field that was tilted in this generation's favor by policies, timing, and demographics. Younger generations aren't failing to replicate this generation's success because they're lazy or entitled. They're failing because the game changed, and nobody told them the new rules.</p>"

This cohort were twenty during the Summer of Love, twenty during the moon landing, twenty during Woodstock. This cohort protested the war, embraced the counterculture, believed this cohort could change the world. This cohort also got drafted, got married young, got jobs that actually paid enough to live on. The economy was strong until the oil crisis hit in 1973. Then stagflation—the economic anomaly that wasn't supposed to exist. This cohort's idealistic decade ended with disco, malaise, gas lines, and the Iranian hostage crisis playing on television every night.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 30s (1979-1989):</strong> Reagan's America. The counterculture gave way to conservatism—or this cohort held onto this cohort's principles while the culture moved right. This cohort settled into careers, raised children, moved to suburbs that looked like the ones this cohort'd grown up in. AIDS emerged and terrified everyone. The Cold War froze deeper. Wall Street boomed. Gordon Gekko proclaimed that greed was good. Yuppies were invented, and this cohort might have been one, or this cohort might have mocked them while secretly envying their BMWs. This was the decade of Morning in America, whether this cohort bought the slogan or not.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 40s (1989-1999):</strong> Everything this cohort'd been told to fear this cohort's entire life simply vanished. The Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War ended not with a bang but with champagne and sledgehammers. The existential threat of this cohort's childhood was suddenly history. The nineties brought the Clinton boom, the internet, globalization's promises. This cohort's kids became teenagers—incomprehensible and expensive. This cohort's parents started aging—needing more, giving less. This cohort were firmly middle-aged, sandwiched between generations, responsible for everyone.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 50s (1999-2009):</strong> This cohort entered this decade at the peak of American triumphalism. The Cold War won. The economy booming. Y2K a fizzle. The future looked like more of the present, only better. Then September 11, 2001. This cohort were fifty-two. Old enough to have perspective on tragedy, young enough to be shaken to this cohort's core. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq followed. The housing bubble inflated, and this cohort watched this cohort's home equity climb. Then 2008: the crash, the bailouts, this cohort's 401(k) cut in half. This cohort's fifties began in optimism and ended in rubble.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 60s (2009-2019):</strong> Recovery—though perhaps not complete recovery. The economy improved, slowly. This cohort retired, or started planning for it seriously. Grandchildren arrived. This cohort's health became something this cohort thought about more than this cohort used to—the checkups, the medications, the mortality that had been theoretical becoming concrete. Politics grew more polarized. The world this cohort's grandchildren inhabited seemed foreign: all screens and anxiety and climate news. This cohort voted, because this cohort's generation always votes, and politicians knew it.</p><p><strong>This cohort's 70s (2019-2029):</strong> This cohort're here now. COVID-19 arrived when this cohort was seventy and put this cohort in the vulnerable category—a demographic designation that felt like a verdict. The world changed again, as it keeps doing. This cohort're navigating late life in a country that sometimes feels unrecognizable from the one this cohort grew up in. This cohort's generation still holds wealth, political power, institutional authority. The question isn't what this cohort accomplished—it's what this cohort do with the years that remain, and how this cohort're remembered when they're gone.</p>"

This generation's demographic weight bent every institution this generation touched: schools, jobs, housing, politics. Being numerous was power, even if this generation rarely named it as such.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They remembered the bread lines. They fought the war or lived through its deprivations. Scarcity shaped them—made them cautious, conformist, grateful for stability. Boomers grew up during abundance, which made this generation confident enough to question everything they'd accepted. Boomers were the generation that said 'don't trust anyone over 30,' then turned 30 and expected to be trusted. They saved their money and kept their heads down. Boomers bought houses and demanded attention.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> They grew up in this generation's shadow, literally. Smaller cohort, fewer resources, less attention. By the time they entered the workforce, this generation'd taken the entry-level jobs and weren't leaving. By the time they wanted promotions, this generation was blocking the ladder. They're sometimes called the forgotten generation—sandwiched between Boomers who won't retire and Millennials who complain more loudly. The resentment is quiet but real.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"pull-quote\">Boomers had every economic advantage, and the numbers prove it.</span> Boomers bought houses when median home prices were three times median income. They're buying (or not buying) when it's six times. Boomers got pensions. They got 401(k)s and the advice to 'just invest.' Boomers graduated without debt. They graduated with <span class=\"stat-box\">$30,000</span> average, into the worst job market since the Great Depression—the one this generation's generation's financial system created. The intergenerational resentment is real, and it's not entirely unfair.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Boomers're from different planets. They don't remember a world before smartphones. They've never known economic security as anything other than an abstraction. Climate change isn't a future threat to them—it's the present, the water they swim in. Boomers have grandchildren their age. The gap between this generation's childhood and theirs is so vast it's almost anthropological. They watch this generation with a mixture of curiosity and judgment, trying to understand how this generation could have had so much and done so little with the knowledge this generation had.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">This generation's generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> This generation's life expectancy at birth was 68 years. If this generation've made it to 75, this generation can expect to live into this generation's mid-80s. Medical advances have extended this generation's life—though they've also extended the period of decline, the years of managing conditions rather than curing them. Boomers'll spend more time in retirement than this generation's parents did, which is a mixed blessing: more years, but more expensive years.</p><p>This generation's generation's legacy is genuinely complicated. Boomers changed the world—marched for civil rights, pushed for feminism, launched the environmental movement, built the technology age. Boomers also accumulated wealth while pulling up ladders, ignored climate warnings when action was still easy, and presided over the greatest inequality since the Gilded Age. History will judge this generation, as it judges every generation. The verdict isn't in yet, but the evidence is mounting.</p>"
