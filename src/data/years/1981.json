Everyone who came after you in your generation was shaped by patterns you helped establish, whether you knew it or not.</p><p>Your childhood was the Reagan era—optimistic rhetoric, trickle-down economics, the Cold War's final act. You were eight when the Berlin Wall fell. Nine when the Soviet Union started collapsing. You were old enough to understand that something big was happening, young enough to assume this was just how history worked.</p><p>Technology during your childhood was transitioning. You probably had a rotary phone at home, then a touch-tone. Your family might have gotten a VCR when you were young. Personal computers arrived in middle school—Apples in the classroom, maybe a Commodore or IBM at home if your family was early adopters.</p><p>You watched Saturday morning cartoons and after-school specials. The Challenger exploded when you were five—you might remember watching it in school, the confusion of adults who didn't know what to say. That was an early lesson: the future wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>Your childhood ended with the Gulf War on TV—the first war broadcast in real-time, the first war that looked like a video game. You were ten, old enough to be confused by what war meant, young enough to be fascinated by the footage.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Raiders of the Lost Ark redefined action movies and MTV told everyone that video killed the radio star. Pop culture was accelerating, fragmenting, becoming something new. You were there at the beginning of whatever this was.</p><p>Your childhood TV was The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Growing Pains—sitcoms about families that were nothing like your actual family but felt aspirational. Nickelodeon was new. Nintendo arrived when you were four. You were the first generation raised on video games from the start.</p><p>Your teenage years were grunge and gangsta rap—Kurt Cobain and Tupac, both dead before you finished high school. The optimism of the '80s had curdled. Music got angry, or at least performed anger convincingly. You were old enough to feel it, young enough to think it was profound.</p><p>You were thirteen when Pulp Fiction made nonlinear storytelling cool. Fourteen when the internet went mainstream. Fifteen when Friends started and every coffee shop became Central Perk. Sixteen when the Macarena proved that cultural consensus was still possible, even if it was stupid.</p><p>Your twenties were defined by reality TV, social media's arrival, and the death of the monoculture. You watched MTV stop playing music. You watched newspapers start dying. You watched everything you grew up with become obsolete, and you were only in your twenties.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born the year the IBM PC launched, which means personal computers have technically existed your entire life—but you didn't have one in your house until later. Technology in 1981 was still typewriters and encyclopedias. The revolution was starting, but it hadn't reached your living room yet.</p><p>You were four when Nintendo came to America. Seven when you probably got your first console. Video games weren't new technology to you; they were just how things were. You've been a gamer your entire life, even if you don't identify that way.</p><p>You were fourteen when the internet went mainstream. Fifteen when you probably got your first email address. AOL Instant Messenger launched when you were sixteen. You were young enough to adopt it immediately, old enough to remember life before it.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_FACEBOOK}} when Facebook launched, {{AGE_AT_IPHONE}} when the iPhone arrived. You were a working adult by then, which means you adopted smartphones as tools rather than growing up with them as extensions of yourself. That's a meaningful difference.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is ambivalent. You're digital immigrants who arrived early enough to pass as natives. You can adapt to new platforms, but you remember when platforms didn't exist. You're fluent but not native. That gives you perspective younger people lack—and maybe some nostalgia that gets in the way.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were four when the Challenger exploded. Five when Chernobyl melted down. Your earliest memories of 'news' were disasters—technology failing spectacularly, the future revealing itself as fragile. You learned early that progress wasn't automatic.</p><p>You were eight when the Berlin Wall fell. Ten when the Gulf War played out on CNN. The Cold War ended during your childhood, replaced by a confusing new world order that adults kept promising would be better. Sometimes it was.</p><p>You were sixteen when Princess Diana died. Seventeen during the Lewinsky scandal. Eighteen during Columbine—old enough to process it as a turning point, young enough to be terrified that your school might be next. School shootings weren't normalized yet. They would be.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_911}} during 9/11. Twenty years old. Old enough to be drafted if there'd been a draft. Old enough to enlist. Old enough to watch friends ship out to Afghanistan and Iraq. The wars that started that day continued for most of your adult life.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}} during the 2008 financial crisis. You'd just started your career, maybe just bought your first house. The economy collapsed right when you were supposed to be building a foundation. You've been catching up ever since.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_COVID}} during COVID. Old enough to have established careers disrupted. Old enough to have kids whose education was derailed. Old enough to lose parents. The pandemic hit your generation in the middle of everything—careers, families, lives—and rearranged it all.</p>"

The internet was going to change everything, and if you could code even a little, companies were throwing money at you. Then the bubble burst.</p><p>The 2001 recession was your first career setback. The 2008 recession was your second, and it hit harder. You were in your late twenties—building momentum, taking on mortgages, starting families—when the economy fell apart. You spent your thirties recovering from your twenties.</p><p>You've watched the workplace transform around you. Open offices replaced cubicles. Remote work replaced offices. The gig economy created 'flexibility' that often meant 'no benefits.' You've adapted to each change, but adaptation is exhausting.</p><p>You're in your peak earning years now, or should be. Whether that's actually happening depends on your industry, your luck, and whether the last few recessions left any runway. You've got maybe twenty more working years. You're hoping the economy cooperates.</p><p>You're managing people now, probably. The younger workers seem different—more boundaries, less tolerance for workplace dysfunction, more likely to quit jobs that don't fulfill them. Part of you admires it. Part of you resents it. They didn't have to learn the hard way like you did.</p>"

Your financial psychology is shaped by whiplash—optimism followed by crisis, recovery followed by crisis again. You don't trust that good times last.</p><p>You were {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}} during the worst recession since the Depression. Maybe you'd just bought a house. Maybe you watched its value collapse. Maybe you lost a job, or watched friends lose jobs, or took a job you were overqualified for just to stay employed. The scars are still there.</p><p>Your generation was supposed to be the first to do worse than their parents. That prediction has more or less come true. You've accumulated less wealth than Boomers had at your age. Your houses are worth more but cost more. Your salaries are higher but buy less. The math doesn't work the way it used to.</p><p>Student loans are part of your financial identity in ways your parents never experienced. You graduated with debt that followed you for decades. Some of you are still paying it off. The investment was supposed to pay dividends; the dividends have been uneven at best.</p><p>You're caught between helping your kids (who are struggling) and helping your parents (who are aging). The sandwich generation problem is real, and you're in the middle of it. There's never enough money for everything that needs money.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You started in the dot-com boom and ended in the Great Recession. Your twenties were a tale of two economies. You probably changed jobs, changed cities, changed expectations. The life script your parents followed—steady job, early marriage, house by 30—started breaking down.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> Recovery from recession, finally. Your careers stabilized. Maybe you got married, had kids, bought houses—the traditional milestones, delayed but not abandoned. Social media matured while you were in your thirties, documenting everything. You're the first generation with a comprehensive online record of your adult lives.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> You're in this decade now, or approaching it. COVID hit right when you were supposed to be in your prime. Your kids are in school or approaching it. Your parents are aging. You're managing careers, families, mortgages, health insurance, aging parents, growing kids—all at once, all the time.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> This will be your final career push—the decade to maximize earnings before retirement, if retirement is even possible. Your kids will be launching. Your parents may need more help. You'll be thinking about legacy, about what you've built, about what you're leaving behind.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond ({{SIXTIES_PLUS}}+):</strong> Retirement is a question mark. Social Security may or may not exist in its current form. Your 401(k) may or may not be enough. Climate change will reshape where you can live. The future is less certain than it was for previous generations, and you know it. But you've survived enough already. You'll figure it out.</p>"
