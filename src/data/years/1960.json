      "html": "<h2>Childhood: {{BIRTH_YEAR}}-{{CHILDHOOD_END_YEAR}}</h2><p>You were born the year John F. Kennedy charmed his way into the White House, defeating Richard Nixon in the first televised presidential debate. Nixon looked sweaty and uncomfortable under the studio lights. Kennedy looked like he belonged there. Television changed everything, and you arrived just in time to watch.</p><p>Your earliest memory probably isn't the JFK assassination—you were only three—but you remember the adults around you crying. You remember the television staying on for days. You remember understanding, in that fuzzy way toddlers understand things, that something terrible had happened. That moment became a line in the sand: before and after. Your generation would draw many such lines.</p><p>Your childhood unfolded against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement. You were four when the Civil Rights Act passed. Five when Selma happened. Eight when Martin Luther King Jr. was shot in Memphis. These weren't history lessons—they were the evening news. You ate dinner while watching fire hoses turned on protestors, while cities burned, while the country argued about who deserved to be treated as human.</p><p>Vietnam was the constant drumbeat. You were too young to be drafted, but not too young to watch the draft lottery on TV with your older cousins, your brothers' friends, the boys down the street. The war came into your living room every night—body counts, napalm, protestors. By the time you were ten, you'd seen more combat footage than your grandparents saw in their entire lives.</p><p>Your childhood was Cold War childhood. You did duck-and-cover drills in elementary school, crouching under desks as if that would save you from nuclear annihilation. The space race was the optimistic counterweight—you were nine when Apollo 11 landed, when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon. You watched it live. The whole world did. For one moment, the future looked like progress instead of mutually assured destruction.</p><p>You played outside until the streetlights came on. You drank from garden hoses. Your parents didn't know where you were half the time, and nobody worried about it. Childhood was less supervised, less scheduled, less anxious. The anxiety came later, in different forms, for different reasons.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>You were born the year Alfred Hitchcock released Psycho and terrified everyone who thought they knew what horror movies could be. Janet Leigh's shower scene changed cinema. Your generation would grow up testing boundaries—in film, in music, in everything.</p><p>The pop culture of {{BIRTH_YEAR}} was still in the grip of the 1950s. Elvis was king. The Rat Pack ruled Vegas. TV was wholesome family fare—Leave It to Beaver, Father Knows Best, idealized versions of America that had never existed and never would. But change was coming. You could feel it.</p><p>The Beatles arrived when you were three. By the time you were seven, they'd released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and blown the doors off what popular music could be. You grew up in the Beatles era, the Rolling Stones era, the era when rock and roll stopped being teen rebellion and became the dominant cultural force.</p><p>You were twelve during Woodstock. Too young to go, old enough to know you were missing something important. The counterculture was happening all around you—free love, flower power, drugs, protests. Your older siblings or cousins might have been there. You watched from the sidelines, absorbing it all, forming opinions about what kind of person you wanted to be.</p><p>Your teenage years belonged to classic rock. Led Zeppelin. Pink Floyd. The Who. You probably had strong opinions about Beatles vs. Stones. You taped songs off the radio onto cassettes. You spent hours in record stores, flipping through albums, judging them by their covers because that's all you had to go on.</p><p>Movies in your formative years were The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars. You saw them in theaters, the way they were meant to be seen, before home video changed how movies got consumed. The 1970s were a golden age of American cinema, and you were there for it—Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown. Dark, complicated films for a dark, complicated time.</p><p>Television grew up with you. All in the Family brought social issues into the sitcom. M*A*S*H used a Korean War setting to comment on Vietnam. The news became entertainment, entertainment became news, and the lines started blurring in ways that would define the next fifty years.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>You were born into a world of rotary phones, black-and-white televisions, and typewriters. The most advanced technology in your childhood home was probably the television set, which your family gathered around like a hearth. You had maybe three channels. You watched what was on, when it was on, and that was that.</p><p>Color television became common when you were in elementary school. The moon landing in 1969 was broadcast in grainy black-and-white, but you watched it anyway, nine years old, understanding that something momentous was happening even if the picture quality was terrible. Technology in your childhood was about reaching—reaching the moon, reaching each other, reaching for something better.</p><p>Calculators appeared when you were in high school, and teachers panicked that students would forget how to do math by hand. The same panic would repeat with every new technology for the rest of your life. You learned to tune it out.</p><p>You probably learned to type on an actual typewriter—the manual kind, where you had to really pound the keys. Then electric typewriters. Then, eventually, word processors and computers. You witnessed the entire evolution, from carbon copies to copy machines to email.</p><p>The personal computer revolution happened when you were in your twenties. The Apple II came out in 1977. IBM PCs in 1981. You were already in the workforce, already set in your ways, but you adapted because you had to. You've spent your entire adult life adapting to technology that keeps changing faster than anyone can keep up.</p><p>The internet arrived when you were in your mid-thirties. Email felt revolutionary. The World Wide Web felt like science fiction. You learned to navigate it all—dial-up modems, search engines, smartphones—but you never quite became a native. You remember what life was like before, and sometimes you miss it.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is practical rather than passionate. It's a tool, not an identity. You use what works and ignore what doesn't. You're not impressed by the latest gadget because you've seen gadgets come and go for sixty years. Most of them didn't change anything that mattered.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born during the U-2 incident, when the Soviets shot down an American spy plane and the Cold War got colder. Francis Gary Powers became a household name. Your entire childhood played out under the shadow of potential nuclear war—a shadow so constant it became background noise.</p><p>You were two during the Cuban Missile Crisis, too young to remember the thirteen days when the world came closest to ending. But you grew up with the aftermath: the awareness that it could happen, that everything could end in a flash, that the adults in charge had brought humanity to the brink and might do it again.</p><p>You were three when JFK was assassinated. Five when his brother Robert was shot. Eight when Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. The 1960s were a decade of assassinations, and you were there for all of them. Violence became normalized before you hit double digits.</p><p>Vietnam defined your adolescence. You were fourteen when the war ended, when helicopters evacuated the last Americans from Saigon. You watched it on television—the chaos, the defeat, the shame. Your country lost a war for the first time in your lifetime, and nobody knew how to process it.</p><p>Watergate happened when you were thirteen and fourteen. You watched a president resign in disgrace. You learned, earlier than most generations, that the people in power could be criminals, could lie, could get caught. That lesson stuck.</p><p>You were forty-one on September 11, 2001. Old enough to have a career, a family, a fully formed worldview—and old enough to watch it all get reconfigured. The wars that followed, the security state that emerged, the fear that became permanent—you'd seen political turmoil before, but this was different. This changed the temperature of everything.</p><p>You were forty-eight when the financial crisis hit in 2008. Your retirement accounts evaporated. Your home value crashed. You'd done everything right—saved, invested, planned—and the system failed anyway. You learned that playing by the rules doesn't protect you when the game is rigged.</p><p>You were sixty when COVID-19 arrived. Suddenly you were in the vulnerable population, the demographic being asked to shelter in place while the world figured out what was happening. Your generation, which had survived so much, now faced a threat that specifically targeted people your age.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1982, give or take. The economy was in recession—double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment. Reagan was promising morning in America, but it felt more like a long dark night for anyone trying to start a career. You took what you could get and worked your way up.</p><p>Your generation invented the workaholic ethic that younger generations now reject. You believed in paying your dues, putting in the hours, climbing the ladder. You stayed late. You came in on weekends. You proved your loyalty through presence and sacrifice. The company was supposed to return that loyalty. Sometimes it did. Often it didn't.</p><p>You probably had fewer jobs than younger people will have. Company loyalty was still a thing when you started. Pensions existed. You might even have one—a rarity now, a reminder of a system that worked differently than the one that replaced it.</p><p>You watched technology transform your workplace repeatedly. First computers, then email, then the internet, then smartphones. Every few years, the tools changed and you had to adapt. You did adapt—you're still here—but it was exhausting. Younger people assume this stuff is intuitive. For you, it was learned, often painfully.</p><p>Management structures were different when you started. Hierarchy was clearer. Dress codes were stricter. You wore suits to interviews, suits to work, suits that cost real money because appearance mattered in ways it doesn't anymore. Business casual was a revolution when it arrived.</p><p>You've mentored younger workers who don't understand why you do things the way you do. You've been managed by younger workers who think your methods are outdated. You've navigated the awkwardness of being the oldest person in the room, the one who remembers how things used to work, the one whose experience sometimes matters and sometimes doesn't.</p><p>Retirement is on the horizon now, if you're lucky. Your generation is redefining what retirement looks like—working longer, working part-time, never fully stopping. The golden years your parents enjoyed, with pensions and Social Security that actually covered expenses, might not be available to you in the same way.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your financial worldview was shaped by parents who remembered the Depression. They saved obsessively, distrusted debt, paid cash for everything they could. You inherited some of that caution, but you also came of age during a period of prosperity that made their fears seem excessive.</p><p>You bought your first house when houses were still affordable. Depending on where you live, that house might now be worth ten times what you paid for it. This creates a cognitive disconnect: you worked hard for what you have, but you also benefited from timing that younger people can't replicate. Both things are true.</p><p>You've watched interest rates go from double digits in the early 1980s to nearly zero. You've watched the stock market crash in 1987, 2000, 2008, and 2020. Each time, you were told to stay the course, trust the market, think long-term. Each time, it eventually recovered. But each crash left scars, made you a little more cautious, a little less trusting.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis probably hit you hard. You were in your peak earning years, but your retirement accounts cratered. Your home value dropped. Everything you'd built suddenly felt precarious. You'd been responsible—saved, invested, planned—and it didn't matter. The system failed, and you were caught in the wreckage.</p><p>Social Security is a constant worry. You've paid into it your entire working life. Will it be there when you need it? The projections say yes, mostly, probably, with adjustments. But you've seen enough promises broken to maintain a healthy skepticism. You're planning as if Social Security might not be there, while hoping it will be.</p><p>Your generation holds the most wealth of any living generation. This is a statistical fact that obscures enormous variation. Some Boomers are rich. Many are not. The narrative that your entire generation hoarded wealth while younger generations suffered is too simple. But there's truth in it too—your generation did benefit from an economy that was kinder to workers, from housing that was affordable, from a social contract that hadn't yet been shredded.</p><p>You probably worry about leaving something to your kids, about not being a burden, about having enough for whatever medical expenses old age brings. The financial anxiety doesn't go away—it just changes shape as you age.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s ({{TWENTIES_START}}-{{TWENTIES_END}}):</strong> You came of age during stagflation, oil crises, and disco. The optimism of the 1960s had curdled into the cynicism of the 1970s. You started your career during a recession, took whatever job you could get, and worked your way up through sheer persistence. This decade was about establishing yourself—finding work, maybe getting married, starting to build the life you'd been promised. The promise felt possible then, even if the economy was rough.</p><p><strong>Your 30s ({{THIRTIES_START}}-{{THIRTIES_END}}):</strong> The Reagan years. Morning in America, or so they said. The economy improved. Your career advanced. If you were going to buy a house, you probably did it now. If you were going to have kids, this was the decade. You were building—career, family, stability. The yuppie was the cultural archetype, even if you weren't one. Ambition was in. Greed was good. You worked hard and expected it to pay off.</p><p><strong>Your 40s ({{FORTIES_START}}-{{FORTIES_END}}):</strong> The Clinton years, mostly. The Cold War ended. The economy boomed. The internet arrived. You were in your peak earning years, established in your career, raising teenagers. This was the decade of the midlife crisis—the convertible, the affair, the sudden questioning of everything you'd built. Some of that is cliché. Some of it is real. Forty hits differently when you realize you have more years behind you than ahead.</p><p><strong>Your 50s ({{FIFTIES_START}}-{{FIFTIES_END}}):</strong> September 11 happened at the start of this decade. Your kids were leaving home or already gone. Your parents were aging, needing care, dying. You were sandwiched between generations, responsible for everyone. The 2008 crash wiped out retirement savings just when retirement was becoming visible on the horizon. This decade was about resilience—absorbing shocks, rebuilding, pushing forward despite setbacks.</p><p><strong>Your 60s ({{SIXTIES_START}}-present):</strong> COVID arrived when you were sixty, putting you in the vulnerable category whether you felt vulnerable or not. Retirement is here or approaching. Your body is reminding you that it's been working for six decades. Your grandchildren, if you have them, are growing up in a world you barely recognize. This decade is about legacy—what you leave behind, what mattered, what you'd do differently if you could do it again. The answers aren't always comfortable.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> Life expectancy for your cohort is roughly 78-82 years. You've got time, but not unlimited time. The question isn't just how long you'll live, but how well. Your generation is pioneering what active aging looks like—staying engaged, staying relevant, refusing to disappear quietly. The template for old age is being rewritten, and you're one of the people writing it.</p>"
