      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1960-1972</h2><p>Children born in 1960 arrived in the first year of the new decade, alongside John F. Kennedy's election and the promise that a generational transfer of power was underway. Their birth year coincided with the approval of the birth control pill, the Greensboro sit-ins, and the beginning of the end for the postwar domestic consensus their parents had constructed. These children were born, in other words, at the exact moment the 1950s stopped being the 1950s — though the houses, the routines, and the family structures would take years to catch up.</p><p>Their early childhood still carried the rhythms of the old order. Mothers at home. Fathers at work. Church on Sunday. Dinner at six. But the television, which had been a source of shared family entertainment, was increasingly delivering content that challenged the premises of the world those routines were designed to maintain. Civil rights marches. Vietnam footage. Presidential press conferences about missiles in Cuba. These children grew up in living rooms where the comfortable and the catastrophic arrived through the same screen, separated by a channel change.</p><p>At three, the president was assassinated. These children were toddlers — too young to remember the event itself but old enough to sense its emotional wake. The adults around them were shattered in ways they'd never been before, and children absorbed that disruption even if they couldn't understand its cause. The assassination became part of the atmosphere of their early childhood, referenced and revisited so frequently in the years that followed that it shaped their understanding of the world even without a firsthand memory to anchor it.</p><p>At eight, both King and Kennedy were killed, and the country burned. At nine, the moon landing offered a brief reprieve — a moment when the national project seemed to be about aspiration rather than conflict. These children watched Armstrong's first step with the particular intensity of nine-year-olds who understood, without being told, that they were seeing something that mattered enormously. The moon landing was the brightest point in a childhood otherwise marked by escalating domestic turmoil.</p><p>The later years of their childhood coincided with the early 1970s — a period of cultural hangover, political scandal, and economic uncertainty. Vietnam was winding down without resolution. Watergate was revealing the presidency as something less noble than the civics textbooks had promised. Their parents' generation, the Silent Generation and early Boomers, was visibly struggling to make sense of a country that had changed faster than anyone expected. These children grew up watching adults improvise, and the improvisation was not always convincing.</p><p>What this cohort carries from childhood is a particular kind of flexibility born from living through rapid change. They began in a world that still operated on 1950s assumptions and ended in one that had abandoned most of them. They learned, before they were teenagers, that the rules could change, that the adults didn't always have answers, and that the confident, optimistic America of their earliest years was a historical moment, not a permanent condition. This understanding — pragmatic, unsentimental, earned through observation rather than instruction — would shape how they approached everything that followed.</p>"

They might not remember the specific moment, but they remember the weight of it\u2014adults weeping, the television on for days, a feeling that the world had cracked. This is this generation's defining rupture, the moment that split the American century in two. The optimism of Camelot died in that motorcade.</p><p>This cohort came of age after the protest generation\u2014or knew someone who was. By the time they hit their teenage years, the 1960s had already happened. They missed Woodstock by three years. They were too young for the Summer of Love but old enough to feel its aftershocks. The counterculture was their older siblings' rebellion; they inherited its music, its skepticism, its complicated relationship with authority.</p><p>Vietnam was the wound that wouldn't heal. This cohort was fourteen when Saigon fell, watching helicopters evacuate the last Americans from embassy rooftops. Their older brothers, their friends' brothers, went to war or went to Canada. The draft lottery hung over their childhood like a verdict waiting to be read. They grew up knowing their government could send them to die, and watching it lie about why.</p><p>Watergate taught this generation that presidents were criminals. This cohort was thirteen when Nixon resigned, old enough to follow the hearings, to understand that 'I am not a crook' was exactly what a crook would say. Their parents' generation trusted institutions. This generation learned that institutions lie, cheat, and destroy tapes.</p><p>This generation is blamed now for the world younger generations inherited\u2014the housing crisis, climate change, stripped pensions, soaring inequality. Some of that blame is fair. Some isn't. They didn't individually decide to offshore manufacturing or gut union protections. They just lived through it, making the best choices they could with the information they had. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The 401(k) was sold as freedom, not theft. Suburban sprawl looked like the American Dream, not environmental catastrophe.

Alfred Hitchcock taught Hollywood that terror lived in the everyday, that the real monster could be the boy next door.</p><p>The music of their birth year still belonged to the 1950s: Chubby Checker teaching America 'The Twist,' Elvis in uniform, doo-wop harmonies on AM radio. But Motown had just been founded in Detroit, and Berry Gordy was assembling the talent that would define their teenage years\u2014Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Temptations. The sound of their generation was being born in a two-story house on West Grand Boulevard.</p><p>At four, The Beatles landed at JFK Airport, and nothing was ever the same. This cohort watched them on Ed Sullivan with 73 million other Americans, their parents shaking their heads at the hair, the screaming, the chaos. By seven, they'd released Sgt. Pepper, and rock music had become art. This cohort grew up as rock evolved\u2014from 'I Want to Hold Their Hand' to 'Revolution,' from teenage crush to cultural manifesto.</p><p>Their Saturday mornings were The Flintstones and The Jetsons. Their after-school hours belonged to reruns of I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, and Gilligan's Island. At twelve, All in the Family arrived and blew up the wholesome sitcom formula\u2014suddenly television could say 'prejudice' and 'impotence' and 'abortion.' Archie Bunker was their father's generation, mocked and humanized in equal measure.</p><p>Their teenage years were Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Who. This cohort probably owned Dark Side of the Moon, played it on a turntable with headphones, studying the prism on the cover while the music washed over this cohort. This cohort saw Jaws at fifteen, The Godfather at twelve, Star Wars at seventeen. The 1970s were Hollywood's golden age for actual filmmaking\u2014Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, Apocalypse Now\u2014and this cohort saw them on screens the size of buildings, not phones the size of their palm.</p><p>This cohort taped songs off the radio onto cassettes, timing the pause button to cut out the DJ's voice. This cohort spent hours in record stores\u2014Tower, Sam Goody, Peaches\u2014flipping through albums, judging by cover art because that's all this cohort had. This cohort knew which radio station played what, when. This cohort called in requests and hoped. Music was something this cohort worked for, not something that appeared.</p>"

When it snowed, this cohort knew it wasn't the broadcast\u2014it was their connection to the broadcast.</p><p>At five, this cohort watched news from Vietnam in black and white, then in color as families upgraded their sets. By ten, color TV was standard, and the shift felt seismic\u2014suddenly the world had more dimensions. The moon landing was still broadcast in grainy monochrome, but this cohort watched it anyway, nine years old, understanding that the picture quality mattered less than what this cohort was seeing.</p><p>The rotary phone hung on their kitchen wall, its curly cord stretched to maximum length when this cohort needed privacy. Long distance was expensive\u2014this cohort planned calls in advance, watched the clock, said goodbye before it cost too much. Their phone number started with a word before it became all digits. This cohort memorized the numbers of everyone this cohort knew because there was no other way.</p><p>Calculators arrived when this cohort was in high school\u2014Texas Instruments LED displays that cost a week's wages. Teachers were furious: students would forget how to do math by hand. (They were right, but it didn't matter.) This cohort learned to type on a manual typewriter, pounding keys hard enough to make impressions through carbon paper. The electric typewriter felt like cheating. The word processor, when it came, felt like science fiction.</p><p>This cohort was seventeen when the Apple II launched, twenty-one when IBM introduced the PC. Computers were for businesses, for nerds, for people who understood what 'RAM' meant. This cohort might have encountered one at work in the 1980s\u2014green text on black screens, commands this cohort had to memorize, printers that screamed as they worked. By the time computers became normal, this cohort was already an adult with established habits.</p><p>The internet arrived when this cohort was thirty-five, email when this cohort was thirty-eight, the World Wide Web when this cohort was forty-three. This cohort adapted because this cohort had to\u2014professionally, then personally. But this cohort never became a native. This cohort know what's been lost: phone calls instead of texts, letters instead of emails, looking things up in books instead of Google, being unreachable when this cohort left the house.

Kennedy looked like a movie star. People who listened on radio thought Nixon won. People who watched on television knew the world had changed. Politics would never again be about what this cohort said\u2014it was about how this cohort looked saying it.</p><p>At two, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the edge of nuclear annihilation. This cohort don't remember it, but this cohort inherited its lessons. The fallout shelter signs in basements. The duck-and-cover drills in elementary school, crouching under desks as if plywood could stop an atom bomb. The awareness, always there, that everything could end in thirty minutes if someone in Moscow or Washington made a mistake.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At three, Dallas.</span> The rupture that defines their generation happened while this cohort was a toddler\u2014the details live in their Generational Identity. Here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape their entire understanding of American power. Innocence ended before this cohort knew what innocence was.</p><p>At four, the Civil Rights Act. At five, Selma, Bloody Sunday, the Voting Rights Act. At eight, Martin Luther King Jr. murdered in Memphis, then Bobby Kennedy two months later. The 1960s were a decade of assassinations, and this cohort absorbed them before this cohort could articulate what they meant. Violence against leaders was part of their landscape.</p><p>At nine, Apollo 11. Men walked on the moon, and this cohort watched it happen, the whole family gathered around that glowing box, witnesses to the impossible. 'That's one small step for man.' The static. The blur. The absolute certainty that this cohort was seeing something no human had ever seen. For one night, the future looked like it might keep its promises.</p><p>At fourteen, Saigon fell. Helicopters evacuating Americans from rooftops, people clinging to landing skids, a war that had defined their adolescence ending not in victory but in chaos. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam.

Interest rates at eighteen percent for mortgages. Reagan promised morning in America, but the economy was still recovering from recession.</p><p>The employment contract that existed when this cohort started looked like this: loyalty for security. Show up early, stay late, prove oneself through decades of service. The company provided health insurance, a pension, the promise of a gold watch and a comfortable retirement. This contract actually existed. It was real.</p><p>Then the contract changed. Somewhere in the 1980s and 1990s, companies discovered they could break the old agreement. Pensions became 401(k)s\u2014retirement became the employee's responsibility. Layoffs became 'restructuring,' mass firings became 'right-sizing,' and the job security their parents enjoyed evaporated.</p><p>This generation learned technology on the job, whether they wanted to or not. The computer that appeared on desks in 1985. The email system in 1995. The smartphone that fused work and home into one endless obligation. Every five years, the tools changed and they had to relearn everything. Younger colleagues assumed this was easy. It was never easy.</p><p>They wore suits. Real suits, with ties that matched and shoes that shined. Business casual was a revolution when it arrived\u2014the memo, the confusion, the men who showed up in golf shirts and got sent home.

Working up the nerve to call her house, knowing her father might answer. The sweaty-palmed agony of asking someone to a dance in person, with their voice, while she stood right there and could see their face if she said no.</p><p>Dating happened face to face. This cohort went to movies where this cohort sat in the dark together, hyperaware of the armrest between this cohort. This cohort went to diners and ordered things this cohort could afford. This cohort drove around because driving around was its own activity, the radio providing soundtrack to conversations that lasted until someone had to be home by curfew.</p><p>This cohort got married younger than their kids will. The median marriage age when this cohort turned twenty-five was around 23 for women, 25 for men. By thirty, most of their friends were married, many with kids. The life script was clear: graduate, get job, get married, buy house, have children. The script worked, mostly, for their generation. It stopped working for the ones who followed.</p><p>Divorce was more stigmatized, then less, then more complicated as asset division became a legal industry. Their generation lived through the divorce explosion of the 1970s\u2014this cohort might be a product of it, or a participant, or both. The 'broken home' became just another kind of home. Blended families became normal because they had to.</p><p>This cohort communicate differently than younger generations. This cohort pick up the phone and call\u2014actual calls, with their voice, where this cohort can hear the other person breathe. This cohort write emails with proper salutations and sign-offs.

This cohort wrote letters\u2014actual letters, in envelopes, with stamps. This cohort planned phone calls in advance because the minutes added up.

The danger is assuming that hard work is the only variable\u2014that anyone who worked as hard as this cohort would have achieved what this cohort achieved. The economy that rewarded their labor doesn't exist anymore. Entry-level jobs that bought houses in their twenties require graduate degrees and pay less now. 'Just work harder' is advice from a world that stopped existing.</p><p>Their relationship with technology is functional but shallow. This cohort use it, but this cohort don't understand it\u2014not really. This makes this cohort vulnerable in ways this cohort don't always see: to scams, to misinformation, to algorithms designed to exploit exactly the kind of trust this cohort extend. Healthy skepticism about the internet isn't the same as understanding how it works.</p><p>The progress this cohort witnessed can blind this cohort to the regression others experience. This cohort watched civil rights legislation pass, women enter the workforce, gay marriage become legal. It looks like a straight line toward justice. But rights gained can be rights lost, and the backlash is always building. Younger generations feel the precarity of progress in ways this cohort might not viscerally understand.</p><p>This cohort trust institutions that have spent decades proving they're untrustworthy. Not all of them, not blindly, but enough. The news anchor, the doctor, the financial advisor, the politician who reminds this cohort of someone this cohort liked once. Younger generations' cynicism isn't just attitude\u2014it's evidence-based. They've watched institutions fail in real time, without the memory of when those institutions functioned.</p><p>Climate change is their generation's greatest blind spot. Not because this cohort caused it\u2014the CO2 was accumulating long before their birth\u2014but because this cohort benefited from the cheap energy that accelerated it, and many of this cohort remain reluctant to accept the bill. The suburbs this cohort built, the cars this cohort drove, the flights this cohort took, the consumption that defined postwar prosperity\u2014these have costs that their grandchildren will pay.</p><p>This cohort survived so much that survival itself became an identity. The assassinations, the wars, the recessions, the crashes. But survival isn't the same as understanding.

If this cohort got married, this cohort probably did it here\u2014median age was twenty-three, twenty-five. If this cohort bought a house, interest rates were brutal but prices were human. This cohort built the foundation of adult life in a decade that swung from malaise to excess, from gas lines to greed-is-good.</p><p><strong>Their 30s (1990-2000):</strong> The Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War ended. The existential threat this cohort'd lived under since birth simply vanished. The 1990s felt like exhaling\u2014the economy boomed, crime dropped, the internet emerged, the future looked digital and prosperous.

This cohort was forty-one, old enough to understand immediately that everything had changed, old enough to remember what it felt like before. The decade brought two wars, one stolen election (maybe two), and a financial crisis that vaporized trillions. Their retirement accounts cratered at forty-eight. Their kids were teenagers, or adults, watching this cohort absorb shocks and pretend to be fine. This cohort learned that midlife crisis isn't a clich\u00e9\u2014it's a reasonable response to accumulating evidence.</p><p><strong>Their 50s (2010-2020):</strong> Recovery, supposedly. The economy limped back. Their 401(k) regained its value, or most of it. Their kids left, or didn't, or left and came back. Their parents aged, needed care, died. This cohort became the oldest generation in their family, the one who remembered things nobody else was alive to remember. Retirement started to feel real\u2014not distant, not someday, but soon. This cohort counted years differently.</p><p><strong>Their 60s (2020-present):</strong> COVID arrived when this cohort was sixty. Suddenly this cohort was the vulnerable population, the demographic hospitals triage against, the reason for lockdowns. Retirement, if this cohort could afford it, started looking different than this cohort'd imagined. Less golf, more anxiety. Their grandchildren, if this cohort have them, are growing up in a world this cohort barely recognize\u2014their phones, their memes, their certainty that previous generations broke everything. This generation is supposed to be enjoying the fruits of a lifetime's labor. Some days this cohort do. Some days the fruit tastes like ash.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> Life expectancy for their cohort is roughly 78-82 years. This cohort've got time, but not unlimited time.
