      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1960-1972</h2><p>The smell of Crayola crayons melting on a radiator. The crinkle of wax paper around a peanut butter sandwich. The particular bounce of a Spalding ball off concrete. Your childhood had a texture—everything handmade, homemade, or built to last until it broke and you fixed it yourself.</p><p>At three, something happened that fractured the world in two. You probably don't remember the day directly—you were barely out of diapers—but you remember the aftermath. Adults crying. The television playing for days. Your mother's face when she tried to explain. You didn't understand death yet, but you understood that the grownups were afraid, and that made you afraid too. Dallas changed everything, even if you couldn't name what changed.</p><p>Your toys were built for a generation that expected things to last. Lincoln Logs. Tinkertoys. Erector Sets with actual metal parts that could pinch your fingers. At four, you got your first Etch A Sketch—that silver box that felt like magic, turning two white knobs to make lines appear and disappear. You probably spent hours trying to draw curves before accepting they were impossible.</p><p>Saturdays meant cartoons—but not all day. You had until noon, maybe one o'clock, before the test pattern returned. The Flintstones premiered the year you were born, television's first prime-time animated show. By five, you'd graduated to Jonny Quest and The Jetsons, imagining futures that looked nothing like your wood-paneled living room. Saturday mornings also meant cereal—Sugar Pops, Froot Loops, Cap'n Crunch—eaten cross-legged on the carpet while your parents slept in.</p><p>At nine, you watched men walk on the moon. July 20, 1969. Your family gathered around the television—that furniture-sized console with the rabbit ears your father constantly adjusted. The picture was grainy, the voices crackling with static, but you understood you were witnessing something that had never happened before. Neil Armstrong's boot in the lunar dust. 'One small step.' You stayed up past your bedtime because this mattered more than sleep.</p><p>Your neighborhood was your universe. You biked everywhere—to the candy store for Atomic Fireballs and Pixy Stix, to the vacant lot where you played until streetlights flickered on. Nobody wore helmets. Nobody had playdates. You had adventures that your parents never heard about, scrapes you hid, friendships forged through shared near-misses. Freedom was the default, and you didn't know to call it that.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The label stuck because 4.3 million of you were born in 1960 alone—part of a demographic tidal wave that reshaped everything from school construction to diaper manufacturing. The hospitals couldn't keep up. The schools would build additions for decades trying to accommodate you. You were always part of a crowd. Your generation is <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Americans—the largest in history until Millennials eventually caught up.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At three, President Kennedy was shot in Dallas. November 22, 1963.</span> You were a toddler. You might not remember the specific moment, but you remember the weight of it—adults weeping, the television on for days, a feeling that the world had cracked. This is your generation's defining rupture, the moment that split the American century in two. The optimism of Camelot died in that motorcade.</p><p>You were the protest generation—or you knew someone who was. By the time you hit your teenage years, the 1960s had already happened. You missed Woodstock by three years. You were too young for the Summer of Love but old enough to feel its aftershocks. The counterculture was your older siblings' rebellion; you inherited its music, its skepticism, its complicated relationship with authority.</p><p>Vietnam was the wound that wouldn't heal. You were fourteen when Saigon fell, watching helicopters evacuate the last Americans from embassy rooftops. Your older brothers, your friends' brothers, went to war or went to Canada. The draft lottery hung over your childhood like a verdict waiting to be read. You grew up knowing your government could send you to die, and watching it lie about why.</p><p>Watergate taught you that presidents were criminals. You were thirteen when Nixon resigned, old enough to follow the hearings, to understand that 'I am not a crook' was exactly what a crook would say. Your parents' generation trusted institutions. Your generation learned that institutions lie, cheat, and destroy tapes.</p><p>You're blamed now for the world younger generations inherited—the housing crisis, climate change, stripped pensions, soaring inequality. Some of that blame is fair. Some isn't. You didn't individually decide to offshore manufacturing or gut union protections. You just lived through it, making the best choices you could with the information you had. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The 401(k) was sold as freedom, not theft. Suburban sprawl looked like the American Dream, not environmental catastrophe. Hindsight is brutal to everyone who lived through history in real time.</span></p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, you were {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Another rupture, another before-and-after, another moment when the world cracked open and revealed something darker underneath.</p>"

    "pop_culture": {
      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Psycho premiered the year you were born—Janet Leigh's shower scene changing what movies could do to audiences. You wouldn't see it for years, but its influence seeped into every horror film that followed. Alfred Hitchcock taught Hollywood that terror lived in the everyday, that the real monster could be the boy next door.</p><p>The music of your birth year still belonged to the 1950s: Chubby Checker teaching America 'The Twist,' Elvis in uniform, doo-wop harmonies on AM radio. But Motown had just been founded in Detroit, and Berry Gordy was assembling the talent that would define your teenage years—Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Temptations. The sound of your generation was being born in a two-story house on West Grand Boulevard.</p><p>At four, The Beatles landed at JFK Airport, and nothing was ever the same. You watched them on Ed Sullivan with 73 million other Americans, your parents shaking their heads at the hair, the screaming, the chaos. By seven, they'd released Sgt. Pepper, and rock music had become art. You grew up as rock evolved—from 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' to 'Revolution,' from teenage crush to cultural manifesto.</p><p>Your Saturday mornings were The Flintstones and The Jetsons. Your after-school hours belonged to reruns of I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, and Gilligan's Island. At twelve, All in the Family arrived and blew up the wholesome sitcom formula—suddenly television could say 'prejudice' and 'impotence' and 'abortion.' Archie Bunker was your father's generation, mocked and humanized in equal measure.</p><p>Your teenage years were Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Who. You probably owned Dark Side of the Moon, played it on a turntable with headphones, studying the prism on the cover while the music washed over you. You saw Jaws at fifteen, The Godfather at twelve, Star Wars at seventeen. The 1970s were Hollywood's golden age for actual filmmaking—Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, Apocalypse Now—and you saw them on screens the size of buildings, not phones the size of your palm.</p><p>You taped songs off the radio onto cassettes, timing the pause button to cut out the DJ's voice. You spent hours in record stores—Tower, Sam Goody, Peaches—flipping through albums, judging by cover art because that's all you had. You knew which radio station played what, when. You called in requests and hoped. Music was something you worked for, not something that appeared.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The television in your childhood living room was furniture—a wooden cabinet with a glass screen that took thirty seconds to warm up. You had three channels, maybe four if the weather cooperated and someone held the antenna at the right angle. When the picture rolled, you adjusted the vertical hold. When it snowed, you knew it wasn't the broadcast—it was your connection to the broadcast.</p><p>At five, you watched news from Vietnam in black and white, then in color as families upgraded their sets. By ten, color TV was standard, and the shift felt seismic—suddenly the world had more dimensions. The moon landing was still broadcast in grainy monochrome, but you watched it anyway, nine years old, understanding that the picture quality mattered less than what you were seeing.</p><p>The rotary phone hung on your kitchen wall, its curly cord stretched to maximum length when you needed privacy. Long distance was expensive—you planned calls in advance, watched the clock, said goodbye before it cost too much. Your phone number started with a word before it became all digits. You memorized the numbers of everyone you knew because there was no other way.</p><p>Calculators arrived when you were in high school—Texas Instruments LED displays that cost a week's wages. Teachers were furious: students would forget how to do math by hand. (They were right, but it didn't matter.) You learned to type on a manual typewriter, pounding keys hard enough to make impressions through carbon paper. The electric typewriter felt like cheating. The word processor, when it came, felt like science fiction.</p><p>You were seventeen when the Apple II launched, twenty-one when IBM introduced the PC. Computers were for businesses, for nerds, for people who understood what 'RAM' meant. You might have encountered one at work in the 1980s—green text on black screens, commands you had to memorize, printers that screamed as they worked. By the time computers became normal, you were already an adult with established habits.</p><p>The internet arrived when you were thirty-five, email when you were thirty-eight, the World Wide Web when you were forty-three. You adapted because you had to—professionally, then personally. But you never became a native. You know what's been lost: phone calls instead of texts, letters instead of emails, looking things up in books instead of Google, being unreachable when you left the house. You're not nostalgic for inconvenience. You're nostalgic for presence.</p>"

    "historical_milestones": {
      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>You were born the year JFK and Nixon faced off in the first televised presidential debate. Nixon looked pale, sweaty, five-o'clock-shadowed. Kennedy looked like a movie star. People who listened on radio thought Nixon won. People who watched on television knew the world had changed. Politics would never again be about what you said—it was about how you looked saying it.</p><p>At two, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the edge of nuclear annihilation. You don't remember it, but you inherited its lessons. The fallout shelter signs in basements. The duck-and-cover drills in elementary school, crouching under desks as if plywood could stop an atom bomb. The awareness, always there, that everything could end in thirty minutes if someone in Moscow or Washington made a mistake.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At three, Dallas.</span> The rupture that defines your generation happened while you were a toddler—the details live in your Generational Identity. Here, what matters is that it launched a decade of violence against leaders that would shape your entire understanding of American power. Innocence ended before you knew what innocence was.</p><p>At four, the Civil Rights Act. At five, Selma, Bloody Sunday, the Voting Rights Act. At eight, Martin Luther King Jr. murdered in Memphis, then Bobby Kennedy two months later. The 1960s were a decade of assassinations, and you absorbed them before you could articulate what they meant. Violence against leaders was part of your landscape.</p><p>At nine, Apollo 11. Men walked on the moon, and you watched it happen, the whole family gathered around that glowing box, witnesses to the impossible. 'That's one small step for man.' The static. The blur. The absolute certainty that you were seeing something no human had ever seen. For one night, the future looked like it might keep its promises.</p><p>At fourteen, Saigon fell. Helicopters evacuating Americans from rooftops, people clinging to landing skids, a war that had defined your adolescence ending not in victory but in chaos. <span class=\"stat-box\">58,220</span> Americans died in Vietnam. At fifteen, you watched Nixon resign—'I am not a crook' replaced by 'I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.' <span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, 9/11.</span> At forty-eight, the financial collapse. At sixty, COVID. The crises keep coming. You've survived all of them so far.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1982, into the teeth of a recession. Double-digit inflation. Unemployment over ten percent. Interest rates at eighteen percent if you wanted to buy a house, which you couldn't afford anyway. Reagan promised morning in America, but morning felt a long way off when you were sending resumes into void after void.</p><p>The deal you were offered looked like this: loyalty for security. You showed up early, stayed late, didn't complain, didn't job-hop, proved yourself through decades of service. The company provided health insurance, a pension, the promise of a gold watch and a comfortable retirement. This deal actually existed when you started. It was real. You believed in it because believing in it made sense.</p><p>Then the deal changed. Somewhere in the 1980s and 1990s, companies discovered they could break the old contract. Pensions became 401(k)s—your retirement was now your problem. Layoffs became 'restructuring,' mass firings became 'right-sizing,' and the job security your parents enjoyed evaporated. <span class=\"pull-quote\">You adapted. You always adapted. But the betrayal lingered.</span></p><p>You learned technology on the job, whether you wanted to or not. The computer that appeared on your desk in 1985. The email system in 1995. The smartphone that fused work and home into one endless obligation. Every five years, the tools changed and you had to relearn everything. Younger colleagues assumed this was easy. It was never easy. You just got good at pretending.</p><p>You wore suits. Real suits, with ties that matched and shoes that shined. Business casual was a revolution when it arrived—you remember the memo, the confusion, the men who showed up in golf shirts and got sent home. Dress codes mattered because appearance mattered because the job was a performance, every day, for decades.</p><p>Now younger workers want flexible hours, remote options, unlimited vacation, mental health days. They think the way you worked—the long hours, the face time, the proving yourself through presence—was unhealthy. <span class=\"pull-quote\">They're right. But that was the game, and you played it the only way you could.</span> You didn't have the option to refuse terms that hadn't been invented yet.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis hit—and you watched retirement plans evaporate overnight.</span> The market recovered eventually. The lesson didn't fade.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Courtship in your era involved actual effort. Learning her class schedule so you could 'accidentally' walk the same route. Working up the nerve to call her house, knowing her father might answer. The sweaty-palmed agony of asking someone to a dance in person, with your voice, while she stood right there and could see your face if she said no.</p><p>Dating happened face to face. You went to movies where you sat in the dark together, hyperaware of the armrest between you. You went to diners and ordered things you could afford. You drove around because driving around was its own activity, the radio providing soundtrack to conversations that lasted until someone had to be home by curfew.</p><p>You got married younger than your kids will. The median marriage age when you turned twenty-five was around 23 for women, 25 for men. By thirty, most of your friends were married, many with kids. The life script was clear: graduate, get job, get married, buy house, have children. The script worked, mostly, for your generation. It stopped working for the ones who followed.</p><p>Divorce was more stigmatized, then less, then more complicated as asset division became a legal industry. Your generation lived through the divorce explosion of the 1970s—you might be a product of it, or a participant, or both. The 'broken home' became just another kind of home. Blended families became normal because they had to.</p><p>You communicate differently than younger generations. You pick up the phone and call—actual calls, with your voice, where you can hear the other person breathe. You write emails with proper salutations and sign-offs. You're confused by texting's lack of punctuation, by emojis replacing words, by the way your grandchildren can have entire conversations without ever speaking aloud.</p><p>Long-distance relationships were hard when long distance cost money. You wrote letters—actual letters, in envelopes, with stamps. You planned phone calls in advance because the minutes added up. You couldn't know where someone was at every moment, and you didn't expect to. Trust meant trusting, not tracking.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents remembered the Great Depression with the clarity of trauma. They saved obsessively. They distrusted debt. They fixed things instead of replacing them, kept pantries stocked, prepared for the worst because they'd lived through the worst. You inherited their caution, even as postwar prosperity suggested caution was unnecessary.</p><p>A median house in 1985, when you were twenty-five, cost about <span class=\"stat-box\">$75,000</span>—roughly 2.5 times the median household income. You bought at the right time. The same house now costs over <span class=\"stat-box\">$400,000</span>—more than five times the median income. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The math of housing shifted beneath you, lifting you higher without effort.</span></p><p>You watched interest rates do things that would seem fictional now. Mortgage rates hit 18% in 1981. A savings account paid 15%. The rules of money were different—borrowing was expensive, saving was rewarded, inflation was the enemy you actually fought. You learned financial discipline in an economy that demanded it.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">The 2008 crisis caught you at the worst moment.</span> You were forty-eight, in your peak earning years, retirement finally visible on the horizon—and your 401(k) lost half its value. Your house was suddenly underwater. Everything you'd built through decades of discipline and delayed gratification turned precarious overnight. The market recovered, eventually. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The lesson didn't fade: the floor can fall out at any moment.</span></p><p>Social Security sits in your mind like a promise that might be broken. You've paid in for forty-plus years. The projections say it will be there, mostly, with adjustments. But you've seen enough promises broken to hedge your bets. You're planning as if it might not exist, hoping that it will, understanding that hope is not a financial strategy.</p><p>The 401(k) replaced the pension during your career—all the risk transferred to you, all the responsibility for investing correctly, all the anxiety about whether your spreadsheets were right. Your parents got defined benefits and never worried about outliving their money. You got flexibility, control, and chronic uncertainty.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>You worked hard for what you have. This is true. The danger is assuming that hard work is the only variable—that anyone who worked as hard as you would have achieved what you achieved. The economy that rewarded your labor doesn't exist anymore. Entry-level jobs that bought houses in your twenties require graduate degrees and pay less now. 'Just work harder' is advice from a world that stopped existing.</p><p>Your relationship with technology is functional but shallow. You use it, but you don't understand it—not really. This makes you vulnerable in ways you don't always see: to scams, to misinformation, to algorithms designed to exploit exactly the kind of trust you extend. Healthy skepticism about the internet isn't the same as understanding how it works.</p><p>The progress you witnessed can blind you to the regression others experience. You watched civil rights legislation pass, women enter the workforce, gay marriage become legal. It looks like a straight line toward justice. But rights gained can be rights lost, and the backlash is always building. Younger generations feel the precarity of progress in ways you might not viscerally understand.</p><p>You trust institutions that have spent decades proving they're untrustworthy. Not all of them, not blindly, but enough. The news anchor, the doctor, the financial advisor, the politician who reminds you of someone you liked once. Younger generations' cynicism isn't just attitude—it's evidence-based. They've watched institutions fail in real time, without the memory of when those institutions functioned.</p><p>Climate change is your generation's greatest blind spot. Not because you caused it—the CO2 was accumulating long before your birth—but because you benefited from the cheap energy that accelerated it, and many of you remain reluctant to accept the bill. The suburbs you built, the cars you drove, the flights you took, the consumption that defined postwar prosperity—these have costs that your grandchildren will pay.</p><p>You survived so much that survival itself became an identity. The assassinations, the wars, the recessions, the crashes. But survival isn't the same as understanding. You can live through something without learning from it, can absorb trauma without processing it, can pass on unexamined pain to generations who didn't sign up for the inheritance.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1980-1990):</strong> You entered adulthood during stagflation, oil shocks, and disco's death rattle. Reagan promised morning in America; you were hoping for a job that paid rent. The economy recovered midway through the decade, and so did your prospects. If you got married, you probably did it here—median age was twenty-three, twenty-five. If you bought a house, interest rates were brutal but prices were human. You built the foundation of adult life in a decade that swung from malaise to excess, from gas lines to greed-is-good.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1990-2000):</strong> The Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War ended. The existential threat you'd lived under since birth simply vanished. The 1990s felt like exhaling—the economy boomed, crime dropped, the internet emerged, the future looked digital and prosperous. You were in your prime earning years, climbing whatever ladder you'd chosen. If you had kids, they were young enough to need you. The American Dream, battered but functional, still seemed achievable.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2000-2010):</strong> September 11, 2001. You were forty-one, old enough to understand immediately that everything had changed, old enough to remember what it felt like before. The decade brought two wars, one stolen election (maybe two), and a financial crisis that vaporized trillions. Your retirement accounts cratered at forty-eight. Your kids were teenagers, or adults, watching you absorb shocks and pretend to be fine. You learned that midlife crisis isn't a cliché—it's a reasonable response to accumulating evidence.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2010-2020):</strong> Recovery, supposedly. The economy limped back. Your 401(k) regained its value, or most of it. Your kids left, or didn't, or left and came back. Your parents aged, needed care, died. You became the oldest generation in your family, the one who remembered things nobody else was alive to remember. Retirement started to feel real—not distant, not someday, but soon. You counted years differently.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2020-present):</strong> COVID arrived when you were sixty. Suddenly you were the vulnerable population, the demographic hospitals triage against, the reason for lockdowns. Retirement, if you could afford it, started looking different than you'd imagined. Less golf, more anxiety. Your grandchildren, if you have them, are growing up in a world you barely recognize—their phones, their memes, their certainty that previous generations broke everything. You're supposed to be enjoying the fruits of a lifetime's labor. Some days you do. Some days the fruit tastes like ash.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> Life expectancy for your cohort is roughly 78-82 years. You've got time, but not unlimited time. The question is what you do with it—how much you can repair, reconcile, pass on. Legacy becomes unavoidable. The stories you tell, the lessons you share, the things you wish you'd done differently. Your generation is rewriting what aging looks like, refusing the rocking chair, staying engaged past the ages when your grandparents disappeared. The ending isn't written yet. You're still holding the pen.</p>"

You've been the main character of American history for sixty years. That era is ending.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They were too young for World War II but too old for rock and roll. They followed the rules, trusted institutions, built careers in single companies. They got pensions. They retired at sixty-five. They were the last generation to believe fully in the American bargain: work hard, play by the rules, get taken care of. You questioned that bargain. Your children discovered it had been revoked.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The forgotten middle children. They came of age during divorce culture, latchkey childhoods, and the AIDS crisis. They were too young for Vietnam, too old for the internet's native benefits. They're perpetually overshadowed—by your generation's cultural dominance, by Millennials' grievances, by their own studied indifference. They got the same degrees you did but entered a job market that was already beginning to fray. They adapted by expecting nothing.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> <span class=\"hero-callout\">Your generation controls <span class=\"stat-box\">52%</span> of American wealth while comprising <span class=\"stat-box\">21%</span> of the population.</span> They graduated into craters—2008, 2020, whatever comes next. They did everything you told them (college, degrees, 'follow your passion') and got student debt and unpaid internships. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The resentment runs deep. Some of it is displaced. Not all of it.</span></p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> They were born after the internet, after 9/11, after the old world stopped existing. They've never known a stable climate, a functional political consensus, or a housing market they could enter. They communicate in images and irony because words failed long before they arrived. They're not cynical—they're realistic about a system that never promised them anything. They don't hate you personally. They just don't believe anything you built will last.</p><p>The wealth gap tells the story: your generation controlled 21% of national wealth at the age Millennials are now. They control about 7%. These aren't personal failings—they're structural transfers, policy choices, the accumulated advantage of being born when the ladder still had rungs. You didn't steal anything. The system you participated in simply funneled resources upward, and you happened to be up.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. Modern medicine extended that—you can reasonably expect 80, maybe longer with luck and good genes. You've outlived more assumptions than any generation before you. The world you were born into—rotary phones, black-and-white TV, segregated lunch counters—has vanished. The world you'll leave behind is unrecognizable. That's the Boomer experience: everything changed, including you.</p>"
