      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1969-1981</h2><p>The smell of Play-Doh and Elmer's glue. The satisfying click of a View-Master advancing to the next slide. The weight of a Big Wheel under you, plastic wheels grinding against sidewalk cracks. Your childhood had a freedom that parents today would call neglect—and it was magnificent.</p><p>Man walked on the moon the summer you were born, and Sesame Street premiered that fall. You were raised by Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and the Electric Company. 'Hey you guuuuys!' At five, you watched Mr. Rogers tell you he liked you just the way you were—maybe the only adult who did. Saturday mornings were sacred: Scooby-Doo Where Are You!, The Brady Bunch, and HR Pufnstuf if you were into weird puppets.</p><p>Your toys were dangerous and wonderful. Clackers that could crack your wrist. Lawn darts that could impale a sibling. Creepy Crawlers with that burning-hot Thingmaker oven. You had Hot Wheels with orange track, a Lite-Brite that ate those tiny pegs, and Shrinky Dinks that somehow never came out right. Evel Knievel stunt cycle. Stretch Armstrong. The Six Million Dollar Man action figure with bionic eye you could look through.</p><p>You ate Pop-Tarts (frosted strawberry, no other flavor existed), drank Tang because astronauts drank Tang, and begged for Count Chocula and Franken Berry cereals. Jiffy Pop on the stove—watching that aluminum dome expand was prime entertainment. TV dinners in their compartmentalized aluminum trays, Swanson's, eaten in front of the television because that's what TV dinners were for.</p><p>You were a latchkey kid before anyone had a name for it. Key on a string around your neck. Let yourself in after school. Made yourself a snack—maybe some Bugles on your fingertips, pretending you had witch claws. Watched Gilligan's Island reruns and waited for a parent to come home. Your generation raised itself, and honestly, you turned out fine. Mostly.</p><p>At five, Nixon resigned. You didn't understand it, but you understood your parents' faces—the mix of vindication and fear. At ten, you watched the last helicopter leave Saigon on television. The war that had been background noise your entire childhood was finally over. America had lost something, and nobody seemed sure what came next.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Gen X</h2><p>Gen X. The forgotten middle child. The slacker generation. The latchkey kids who raised themselves while their Boomer parents were busy finding themselves. You're sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials, and you've spent your entire life being overlooked. At this point, it's almost comfortable.</p><p>You were eight when your childhood president resigned in disgrace. Watergate wasn't an abstraction—it was your first lesson in how institutions work. They lie. They cover up. They only admit wrongdoing when the evidence is overwhelming. You've been right to be cynical ever since. Every scandal since has just confirmed what you learned at eight years old.</p><p>Your generation—roughly 65 million Americans born between 1965 and 1980—came of age during the AIDS crisis. You were sixteen when the first cases were reported, and you spent your teens watching a disease kill people while the government did nothing. Rock Hudson died when you were sixteen. Freddie Mercury when you were twenty-two. You learned to associate sex with death in a way that shaped your entire generation's relationship with intimacy.</p><p>The term 'Gen X' comes from Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel about overeducated, underemployed twentysomethings working 'McJobs.' You were twenty-two when that book came out, probably working a McJob yourself—temp work, retail, service industry gigs that paid nothing and led nowhere. The corporate ladder your parents climbed had rungs missing. You learned to build your own ladders, or do without.</p><p>You perfected sarcasm as a defense mechanism. You're suspicious of sincerity, uncomfortable with enthusiasm, and deeply skeptical of anyone who seems to care too much. This isn't nihilism—it's protection. When you expect nothing, you're never disappointed. When you trust no one, you're never betrayed. It's a bleak philosophy, but it works.</p><p>At seventeen, Challenger exploded—January 28, 1986. You watched it in your classroom, Christa McAuliffe reaching for the stars, then that forking plume of smoke seventy-three seconds in. This was Gen X's defining moment: the instant optimism died on live television. The teacher-in-space program was supposed to inspire you. Instead it taught you that systems fail, technology betrays, and watching something unfold in real time doesn't make it less random or cruel. Every generation has its 'where were you?' moment. Yours was sitting in a classroom, watching a shuttle disintegrate, learning that the future wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>You invented indie rock, alternative, and grunge because mainstream culture was plastic and fake. You killed the hair bands with flannel and feedback. Then you watched corporate America co-opt everything you created, package it, and sell it back to you. That's the Gen X experience in miniature: create something real, watch it get commodified, shrug, move on.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Woodstock happened the summer you were born—400,000 people in the mud, Jimi Hendrix playing the Star-Spangled Banner at dawn. You don't remember it, obviously, but it hung over your childhood like legend. Abbey Road came out that fall, the last great Beatles album. The sixties ended the year you began.</p><p>Your childhood TV was a weird mix of earnest and psychedelic. Land of the Lost with its claymation dinosaurs. The Banana Splits, which made no sense but you watched it anyway. Schoolhouse Rock taught you about conjunctions and the Constitution. 'I'm Just a Bill' on Capitol Hill. You can still sing the Preamble because of that Saturday morning cartoon.</p><p>At eight, you saw Star Wars in a theater and everything changed. Princess Leia was a leader, not a damsel. Darth Vader scared you in ways you couldn't articulate. You wanted to be Han Solo. Everyone wanted to be Han Solo. The Millennium Falcon was the coolest thing ever designed. A year later, Superman made you believe a man could fly. Close Encounters showed you aliens could be friendly. Your childhood cinema was pure wonder.</p><p>By twelve, MTV launched. August 1, 1981. 'Video Killed the Radio Star' was the first thing you saw. Suddenly music was visual. Michael Jackson moonwalked. Duran Duran had a yacht. The Police were blond and moody. You learned to judge music by its video, which was shallow but you didn't care. Friday Night Videos if you didn't have cable. Headbangers Ball if you did.</p><p>John Hughes understood your teenage soul. The Breakfast Club when you were sixteen. Ferris Bueller's Day Off when you were seventeen. Pretty in Pink. Some Kind of Wonderful. Sixteen Candles (which has aged... poorly). Hughes knew that high school felt like life or death, even if it wasn't. You still identify as an Allison, a Duckie, a Bender. Maybe all three.</p><p>Your music traced an arc from new wave to alternative to grunge. The Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths—your teenage years. R.E.M., U2, The Replacements—your college years. Then Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden—your twenties. You were twenty-two when 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' dropped, and suddenly the underground was mainstream. You were twenty-five when Kurt Cobain died. Heroin and shotguns. The movement was over before it had really begun.</p><p>You're the last generation with a monoculture. Everyone saw the same movies, watched the same shows, heard the same songs on the same radio stations. When MASH ended, 105 million people watched together. When Dallas revealed who shot JR, it was the only thing anyone talked about. That shared experience is gone now. You're not sure if it's a loss or a liberation. Probably both.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>ARPANET—the internet's ancestor—went live the year you were born. The first message ever sent between computers happened when you were six months old. 'LOGIN,' from UCLA to Stanford. The system crashed after 'LO.' Technology has always been promising miracles and glitching on delivery. You've seen this pattern repeat your entire life.</p><p>Your childhood was analog in ways kids today can't comprehend. The rotary phone on the wall—you could kill time just spinning the dial. The TV with five channels and no remote, requiring you to physically walk across the room to change it. (This is why you watched whatever was on.) The console stereo that weighed 200 pounds and played records your parents owned.</p><p>Pong arrived when you were three. Space Invaders when you were nine. Pac-Man when you were eleven, eating quarters at the arcade like you were feeding a slot machine. The Atari 2600 was the holy grail—if your family had one, your house was headquarters. Combat. Adventure. Pitfall. Graphics that were basically moving squares, but to you, they were everything.</p><p>At eight, the Apple II dropped. At twelve, the IBM PC made computers safe for corporate America. At fifteen, you might have seen your first Macintosh—'Hello, I'm Macintosh'—and understood that computers could be friendly, even if you couldn't afford one. You learned to type on actual typewriters, then adapted to word processors. Your generation bridges manual and digital.</p><p>You were twenty-two when the World Wide Web went public. Twenty-five when the first web browser made it usable. Thirty when Google launched, making all previous search engines obsolete. You learned to use the internet as an adult, which means you remember what research was like before: card catalogs, microfiche, asking librarians. You can still function without Google. It's a superpower now.</p><p>You were thirty-five when Facebook opened to the public. Thirty-eight when the iPhone dropped. You adopted social media skeptically, and you were right to. You've watched it corrode public discourse, shorten attention spans, and turn everyone into brands. You use it—you have to—but you also remember what it was like before everyone had a camera in their pocket and an audience for their opinions. Some days, you miss the quiet.</p><p>Your generation built much of this technology. Gen Xers founded Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, and SpaceX. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin—your cohort. You made the future, but you also remember the promises. The internet was supposed to democratize information and connect humanity. It did those things, while also making everything somehow worse. You saw it coming. Nobody listened. They rarely do.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon while you were in your crib. Your parents watched on a black-and-white television, tears streaming, while you slept through humanity's greatest achievement. They'd tell you about it for the rest of their lives. You were supposed to be living on Mars by now. Instead, you got strip malls and streaming services.</p><p>At five, you watched Nixon resign. 'I am not a crook,' he said, which meant he was definitely a crook. Your parents were glued to the Watergate hearings all summer. This was your first political memory: the President of the United States, lying, caught, humiliated, gone. Every scandal since has felt like a rerun. You've never been surprised when authority fails. You expected it.</p><p>At six, Saigon fell. The last helicopter lifted off the embassy roof while South Vietnamese allies clung to the landing gear. The war your parents had argued about for a decade was over, and America had lost. The footage played on the evening news between dinner and dessert. You learned early that superpower status doesn't mean winning.</p><p>At ten, Americans were held hostage in Iran for 444 days. At eleven, Reagan was shot—you probably heard about it at school, everyone crowded around a radio or TV. At twelve, John Lennon was murdered outside his apartment. The Beatles were already ancient history to you, but your parents grieved like they'd lost a family member. You didn't understand. Someday you would.</p><p>At seventeen, Challenger's smoke trail spread across the Florida sky—the defining Gen X moment that shaped your generation's permanent skepticism of progress and institutions.</p><p>At twenty, the Berlin Wall fell. You watched on TV as Germans took sledgehammers to concrete, as strangers hugged and cried, as the Cold War you'd grown up fearing ended not with missiles but with champagne. At twenty-two, the Soviet Union dissolved. History was supposed to be over. Capitalism won. We'd reached the end. It wasn't the end. It was halftime.</p><p>At thirty-two, you were at work when the towers fell. Maybe you had a corner office by then. Maybe you had kids in daycare. You watched the second plane hit live, and you knew before anyone said it: the world just broke. The forever wars that followed—Afghanistan, Iraq, the whole War on Terror—sent people younger than you to die in places they'd never heard of. You were too old to deploy, too young to lead. Stuck watching from the sidelines.</p><p>At thirty-nine, the financial system collapsed. Unlike the kids just graduating, you had something to lose. Your 401(k) cratered. Your home value plunged. Friends lost houses, jobs, marriages. You'd played by the rules, and the rules had changed while you were playing. Another lesson: the floor can always fall out. Plan accordingly.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You entered the workforce around 1987 if you skipped college, 1991 if you didn't. Either way, the timing was terrible. The '87 crash. The early '90s recession. 'Jobs' became 'McJobs'—a term Douglas Coupland invented specifically to describe your generation's career prospects. Low-wage, low-prestige, low-dignity work in the service economy. Would you like fries with that?</p><p>Your Boomer parents told you to work hard and get ahead. They said it with straight faces, as if the rules that applied to them still applied. They got hired at twenty-two, worked the same job for forty years, got pensions and gold watches. You got temp agencies, no benefits, and the vague promise that maybe someday a permanent position would open up. It usually didn't.</p><p>You invented 'slacking' not because you were lazy—you weren't—but because working hard didn't lead anywhere. The corporate ladder had rungs missing. Promotions went to people with connections. Loyalty was rewarded with layoffs the moment quarterly numbers dipped. You learned fast: the company doesn't love you back. Never did. Never will.</p><p>So you stopped expecting loyalty. You job-hopped because it was the only way to get raises. You kept your resume updated and your options open. Boomers called this disloyal. You called it survival. The social contract between employer and employee had been shredded before you arrived; you just refused to pretend it was still intact.</p><p>The dot-com boom of the late '90s was your first real break. You were twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty—old enough to have skills, young enough to pivot. Some of you got stock options that made you rich. Most of you got experience that would matter later. Then the bubble burst in 2000, and you learned: booms end. Timing is luck. Never count on paper wealth.</p><p>By 2008, you were mid-career. Mortgage, maybe kids, actual things to lose. The crash hit you differently than it hit the kids just graduating—they had nothing, you had something, and you watched it evaporate. Your 401(k) lost forty percent. Your house was suddenly worth less than you paid. But you'd been through recessions before. You knew how to survive. Grim, but useful.</p><p>Now you're in leadership. You manage differently than Boomers did—less micromanaging, more skepticism about corporate mission statements, more willingness to let people work from home and actually mean it. You remember being exploited. You try not to pass it on. Some of you succeed. Some of you become the very Boomers you swore you'd never be. It's a fine line.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when asking someone out meant calling their house and maybe talking to their dad first? When dates were planned days in advance because there was no way to text 'running 5 min late'? When you sat by the phone—the one attached to the wall—waiting for it to ring, because that was your only option?</p><p>You learned romance the old-fashioned way. Passing notes in class, folded into elaborate origami. Mix tapes with carefully sequenced songs that told a story if the recipient was paying attention. Slow dances at school where the DJ played 'Stairway to Heaven' and you had eight minutes of legitimate hand-on-waist contact. The stakes felt enormous because there were no do-overs. You couldn't screenshot anything. The moment was the moment.</p><p>The divorce rate peaked when you were a kid—your parents' generation shattered the illusion that marriage was forever. Half your friends had divorced parents, alternating weekends, two Christmases. This shaped how you approached relationships: cautiously, skeptically, with exit strategies considered. You wanted love, but you'd seen how badly it could end. You kept one foot near the door.</p><p>You delayed marriage compared to your parents. Some of it was economic—you couldn't afford a wedding, let alone a house. Some of it was cultural—you'd watched too many bad marriages implode. You normalized living together first, which scandalized your parents but made perfect sense to you. Why sign a contract before you knew if you could stand each other's morning breath?</p><p>Communication changed more in your lifetime than in any generation before. Landlines to cell phones to smartphones. Letters to email to texts to DMs. You adapted to each platform, but you remember what came before. You remember being unreachable. You remember making plans and keeping them because there was no other choice. You remember the silence, and some days you miss it desperately.</p><p>Your friendships are smaller and deeper than the hundreds of 'friends' younger generations collect online. You have people you've known for forty years. People who remember you before you were who you are now. People who saw you fail and stuck around. That continuity matters more as you age. It's not about quantity. It was never about quantity.</p><p>Social media arrived in your thirties, after your identity was formed. You use it—you have to—but it doesn't define you. You can put the phone down. You can go hours without checking notifications. This isn't discipline; it's just how you were raised. The dopamine machine didn't get you young enough to fully hook you.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your first economic memories are gas lines. You were four during the 1973 oil crisis, watching your parents wait in line for hours to fill the tank. Price controls. Rationing. The sense that the good times were over and nobody knew when they'd return. This shaped everything about how you think about money.</p><p>Stagflation was the word. High inflation. High unemployment. Simultaneously. Economics professors said it wasn't supposed to be possible. The economy disagreed. By the time Carter used the word 'malaise' in 1979, you were ten and already understood that prosperity wasn't guaranteed. The postwar boom your parents took for granted was ancient history. Scarcity was the new normal.</p><p>You've survived three major recessions as an adult. The early '90s—you were entering the workforce, there were no jobs. The dot-com bust—you had stock options that evaporated overnight. 2008—your house was worth less than your mortgage. Each crash taught the same lesson: economic security is an illusion. The floor can always fall out. Plan accordingly.</p><p>Your relationship with money is pragmatic bordering on paranoid. You don't trust windfalls. You're suspicious of get-rich-quick schemes. You save obsessively, invest conservatively, and still feel like it's not enough. The emergency fund your parents never needed? You've got six months' expenses tucked away, minimum. Because you know how fast things fall apart.</p><p>Housing was supposed to be the path to wealth, and for many of you, it worked—if you bought in the '90s before prices exploded. A starter home in 1995 that cost $120,000 might be worth $500,000 now. That's not investing skill; that's timing. You were lucky. You know it. It doesn't make you feel rich; it makes you feel like you barely dodged something.</p><p>You're sandwiched now. Aging parents who need care, maybe moving in, certainly needing money for assisted living or medical bills. Adult children who can't afford rent, let alone houses, boomeranging back to the basement you converted into an apartment. You're financially responsible for generations on either side while trying to fund a retirement that keeps receding into the distance.</p><p>The numbers say you're better off than Millennials. The numbers are right—timing gave you advantages they didn't get. But 'better off' doesn't mean 'secure.' It means 'slightly less screwed.' You've watched every promise get broken. Social Security might not exist when you need it. Pensions vanished decades ago. You're on your own. You've always been on your own.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Your self-reliance is a superpower and a curse. You learned to figure things out alone because there was no other option. Latchkey kid, remember? But now you don't ask for help even when help exists. You suffer in silence, dismiss your own struggles, tell yourself to toughen up. Therapy? That's for people who can't handle their problems. (This is wrong. Go to therapy.)</p><p>Irony is your native language, and it's limiting you. You deflect sincerity with sarcasm. You hedge everything with detachment. Caring about something openly feels dangerous—what if it fails? What if people mock you? Better to stay cool, stay distant, stay safe behind layers of not-quite-meaning-it. This made you interesting at twenty-two. At fifty-five, it's keeping you from the depth you actually want.</p><p>You have a chip on your shoulder about being ignored. Stuck between Boomers and Millennials, you've spent decades invisible to marketers, politicians, and trend pieces. This has made you prickly about recognition, dismissive of generations that get attention, and sometimes bitter about doing the work while others get the credit. 'Whatever' became your catchphrase for a reason. But 'whatever' isn't a strategy. It's surrender.</p><p>The language around identity, gender, and race has evolved faster than some of you have. Your formative years were less diverse than what came after. You're not bigots—mostly—but you stumble over terminology that didn't exist when you learned to talk about people. Pronouns feel complicated. Categories that seemed fixed are suddenly fluid. Learning feels harder than it should, and the patience for your learning curve is thin. This isn't about being bad. It's about being behind.</p><p>Your cynicism, while often justified, becomes self-defeating. You expect institutions to fail, so you don't engage with them. You expect politicians to disappoint, so you don't vote. You expect systems to be rigged, so you don't try to fix them. The world needs changing, but your generation is more likely to mock the problems than organize around solutions. Ironic detachment is not a political strategy.</p><p>You're technologically capable but not always current. You can use the internet—you basically built it—but you're often a platform or two behind. TikTok feels like too much. Discord seems unnecessary. You're not unable; you're choosing not to. But the cost is cultural: moments happen online that you miss, references that pass you by, a slow drift toward irrelevance that you pretend doesn't bother you. It does.</p><p>And maybe the deepest blind spot: you've accepted less than you deserved for so long that you've forgotten you deserved more. The McJobs, the stagnant wages, the broken promises—you shrugged and adapted. You stopped fighting because fighting felt pointless. But your acceptance became complicity. The system didn't just fail you; you let it fail the generations that came after. You knew better. You could have done more. Most of you didn't.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1989-1999):</strong> You entered adulthood just as the Berlin Wall fell—optimism everywhere, history supposedly over, capitalism triumphant. The early '90s recession knocked you around, but then came the boom. The internet. The stock market climbing. Clinton-era prosperity, or at least the appearance of it. Your twenties were grunge and dot-coms, flannel shirts and IPOs. You figured out who you were outside your parents' house. Some of you got married, started families. Others stayed loose, exploring. The '90s belonged to you—old enough to participate, young enough to enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1999-2009):</strong> The decade that broke everything. You were thirty when Y2K turned out to be nothing. You were thirty-two when 9/11 turned out to be everything. The towers fell. The wars started. The security state emerged. You watched your country become paranoid, angry, fearful—and you felt it too. Then came 2008: the crash, the bailouts, your house worth less than your mortgage. You had kids by then, responsibilities, things to lose. You lost some of them. This decade aged you in ways that don't show on the outside.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (2009-2019):</strong> Recovery. Rebuilding. Middle age. You focused on stability—keeping the job, maintaining the marriage, raising kids who seemed to need different things than you'd needed. Smartphones took over. Social media changed everything. You adapted, but you also resisted, suspicious of how much technology wanted to consume. You hit peak earning years and still felt behind. You were supposed to be established by now. You were supposed to feel secure. You didn't. Nobody told you middle age would feel like this—tired but functional, accomplished but unfulfilled.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2019-2029):</strong> You're here now. COVID hit when you were fifty or fifty-one. Another crisis—you've lost count of how many—but this one was different. Working from home. Kids boomeranging back. Parents in nursing homes you couldn't visit. You adapted, because adapting is what you do. Your kids are grown or nearly grown. Your parents are aging, some already gone. You're thinking about endings: retirement, legacy, what it all meant. The finish line is visible, but the path keeps shifting. You're tired in ways you didn't expect. You're also more comfortable in your skin than you've ever been. Turns out not caring what people think was always the goal. You finally achieved it.</p><p><strong>Your 60s and beyond (2029+):</strong> Retirement is the theory. The practice depends on math you can't fully control: whether you saved enough, whether Social Security survives, whether healthcare costs don't bankrupt you, whether your kids need help, whether your body cooperates. The future isn't the space colony you were promised at eight years old. It's messier, warmer, more uncertain. But you've survived everything so far—stagflation, recessions, wars, crashes, a pandemic. You'll probably survive this too. That's the Gen X way: low expectations, consistent performance. It's not inspiring. It works.</p>"

You're part of Gen X—roughly 65 million Americans, the smallest generation of the 20th century. Sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials, you've spent your entire life being ignored. Marketers skip you. Politicians overlook you. Trend pieces forget you exist. This is annoying, but it's also kind of freeing. Nobody expects anything from you. You can just... do your thing.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> They got the postwar boom, cheap housing, pensions, and the confidence that comes from never being seriously challenged. You got stagflation, Watergate, AIDS, and the end of every promise they took for granted. They went to Woodstock; you inherited the hangover. They got free love; you got the epidemic that made love potentially fatal. They built the systems that would fail you. They lecture you about work ethic from houses that appreciated 400% while they slept.</p><p>But you're more adaptable than they ever had to be. You've navigated recessions, technological revolutions, and social upheavals they can't comprehend. You learned to pivot because staying put wasn't an option. They had safety nets; you became your own.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> They got screwed harder than you did, and they know it. You bought houses when houses were affordable. You entered the job market before it became a hunger game. You paid off student loans before they became life sentences. This makes them resent you, which is fair—timing gave you advantages they never had, even if you didn't feel advantaged at the time. They're louder than you, more earnest, more willing to complain publicly. You find this exhausting. They find your silence complicit. Both views have merit.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You're practically analog to them. You remember life before the internet, before smartphones, before every moment was documented and performed. You can disconnect in ways they find incomprehensible. They're anxious in ways you find confusing—surely having all the world's information in your pocket should make things easier, not harder? You're impressed by their activism, bemused by their nihilism, and occasionally horrified by their TikTok dances. You're old enough to be their parents. Many of you are.</p><p>Your life expectancy is 78-80 years. You've got two, maybe three decades left, statistically. You're healthier than previous generations at this age—less smoking, better medicine, more vegetables—but you're also more stressed, more medicated, and more aware that climate change will make your final chapters interesting in ways you'd rather avoid.</p><p>Your generation's legacy might be pragmatism. You didn't change the world like Boomers claimed to. You didn't break the internet like Millennials did. You just showed up, did the work, expected nothing, and were pleasantly surprised when things occasionally worked out. That's not inspirational. It's not a TED Talk. It's survival, and survival counts for more than people give it credit for.</p>"
