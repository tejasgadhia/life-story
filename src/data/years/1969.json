      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1969-1981</h2><p>The smell of Play-Doh and Elmer's glue. The satisfying click of a View-Master advancing to the next slide. The weight of a Big Wheel under a child, plastic wheels grinding against sidewalk cracks. Childhood in this era had a freedom that parents today would call neglect—and it was magnificent.</p><p>Man walked on the moon the summer of 1969, and Sesame Street premiered that fall. Children were raised by Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and the Electric Company. 'Hey you guuuuys!' At five, children watched Mr. Rogers tell them he liked them just the way they were—maybe the only adult who did. Saturday mornings were sacred: Scooby-Doo Where Are You!, The Brady Bunch, and HR Pufnstuf if children were into weird puppets.</p><p>Toys were dangerous and wonderful. Clackers that could crack wrists. Lawn darts that could impale siblings. Creepy Crawlers with that burning-hot Thingmaker oven. Hot Wheels with orange track, Lite-Brites that ate those tiny pegs, and Shrinky Dinks that somehow never came out right. Evel Knievel stunt cycles. Stretch Armstrong. The Six Million Dollar Man action figure with bionic eye children could look through.</p><p>Children ate Pop-Tarts (frosted strawberry, no other flavor existed), drank Tang because astronauts drank Tang, and begged for Count Chocula and Franken Berry cereals. Jiffy Pop on the stove—watching that aluminum dome expand was prime entertainment. TV dinners in their compartmentalized aluminum trays, Swanson's, eaten in front of the television because that's what TV dinners were for.</p><p>Children were latchkey kids before anyone had a name for it. Key on a string around the neck. Let themselves in after school. Made themselves snacks—maybe some Bugles on fingertips, pretending they had witch claws. Watched Gilligan's Island reruns and waited for a parent to come home. Gen X raised itself, and honestly, they turned out fine. Mostly.</p><p>At five, Nixon resigned. Children didn't understand it, but they understood their parents' faces—the mix of vindication and fear. At ten, children watched the last helicopter leave Saigon on television. The war that had been background noise their entire childhood was finally over. America had lost something, and nobody seemed sure what came next.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>The Gen X Generation</h2><p>Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980. The forgotten middle child. The slacker generation. The latchkey kids who raised themselves while their Boomer parents were busy finding themselves. Gen X is sandwiched between <span class=\"stat-box\">76 million</span> Boomers and <span class=\"stat-box\">72 million</span> Millennials, and Gen X has spent their entire life being overlooked. At this point, it's almost comfortable.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X was five when Nixon resigned.</span> Watergate wasn't an abstraction—it was Gen X's first lesson in how institutions work. They lie. They cover up. They only admit wrongdoing when the evidence is overwhelming. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Authority figures lie, institutions fail, trust is earned, not given.</span> Gen X has been right to be cynical ever since. Every scandal since has just confirmed what Gen X learned as children.</p><p>Gen X—roughly <span class=\"stat-box\">65 million</span> Americans born between 1965 and 1980—came of age during the AIDS crisis. Gen X was sixteen when the first cases were reported, and they spent their teens watching a disease kill people while the government did nothing. Rock Hudson died when Gen X was sixteen. Freddie Mercury when Gen X was twenty-two. Gen X learned to associate sex with death in a way that shaped this generation's relationship with intimacy.</p><p>The term 'Gen X' comes from Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel about overeducated, underemployed twentysomethings working 'McJobs.' Gen X was twenty-two when that book came out, probably working a McJob themselves—temp work, retail, service industry gigs that paid nothing and led nowhere. The corporate ladder their parents climbed had rungs missing. Gen X learned to build their own ladders, or do without.</p><p>Gen X perfected sarcasm as a defense mechanism. This generation is suspicious of sincerity, uncomfortable with enthusiasm, and deeply skeptical of anyone who seems to care too much. This isn't nihilism—it's protection. <span class=\"pull-quote\">When Gen X expects nothing, they're never disappointed. When Gen X trusts no one, they're never betrayed.</span> It's a bleak philosophy, but it works.</p><p>At seventeen, Challenger exploded—January 28, 1986. Gen X watched it in their classrooms, Christa McAuliffe reaching for the stars, then that forking plume of smoke seventy-three seconds in. This was Gen X's defining moment: the instant optimism died on live television. The teacher-in-space program was supposed to inspire Gen X. Instead it taught Gen X that systems fail, technology betrays, and watching something unfold in real time doesn't make it less random or cruel. Every generation has its 'where were you?' moment. Gen X's was sitting in a classroom, watching a shuttle disintegrate, learning that the future wasn't guaranteed.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, Gen X was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Gen X invented indie rock, alternative, and grunge because mainstream culture was plastic and fake. Gen X killed the hair bands with flannel and feedback. Then Gen X watched corporate America co-opt everything they created, package it, and sell it back to them. <span class=\"hero-callout\">Gen X can still entertain themselves without a screen. That's a superpower now.</span></p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>Woodstock happened the summer of 1969—400,000 people in the mud, Jimi Hendrix playing the Star-Spangled Banner at dawn. Gen X doesn't remember it, obviously, but it hung over their childhood like legend. Abbey Road came out that fall, the last great Beatles album. The sixties ended the year Gen X began.</p><p>Childhood TV was a weird mix of earnest and psychedelic. Land of the Lost with its claymation dinosaurs. The Banana Splits, which made no sense but children watched it anyway. Schoolhouse Rock taught about conjunctions and the Constitution. 'I'm Just a Bill' on Capitol Hill. Gen X can still sing the Preamble because of that Saturday morning cartoon.</p><p>At eight, Gen X saw Star Wars in a theater and everything changed. Princess Leia was a leader, not a damsel. Darth Vader scared Gen X in ways they couldn't articulate. Gen X wanted to be Han Solo. Everyone wanted to be Han Solo. The Millennium Falcon was the coolest thing ever designed. A year later, Superman made Gen X believe a man could fly. Close Encounters showed Gen X that aliens could be friendly. Childhood cinema was pure wonder.</p><p>By twelve, MTV launched. August 1, 1981. 'Video Killed the Radio Star' was the first thing Gen X saw. Suddenly music was visual. Michael Jackson moonwalked. Duran Duran had a yacht. The Police were blond and moody. Gen X learned to judge music by its video, which was shallow but Gen X didn't care. Friday Night Videos if Gen X didn't have cable. Headbangers Ball if they did.</p><p>John Hughes understood Gen X's teenage soul. The Breakfast Club when Gen X was sixteen. Ferris Bueller's Day Off when Gen X was seventeen. Pretty in Pink. Some Kind of Wonderful. Sixteen Candles (which has aged... poorly). Hughes knew that high school felt like life or death, even if it wasn't. Gen X still identifies as an Allison, a Duckie, a Bender. Maybe all three.</p><p>Gen X's music traced an arc from new wave to alternative to grunge. The Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths—Gen X's teenage years. R.E.M., U2, The Replacements—Gen X's college years. Then Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden—Gen X's twenties. Gen X was twenty-two when 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' dropped, and suddenly the underground was mainstream. Gen X was twenty-five when Kurt Cobain died. Heroin and shotguns. The movement was over before it had really begun.</p><p>Gen X is the last generation with a monoculture. Everyone saw the same movies, watched the same shows, heard the same songs on the same radio stations. When MASH ended, 105 million people watched together. When Dallas revealed who shot JR, it was the only thing anyone talked about. That shared experience is gone now. Gen X isn't sure if it's a loss or a liberation. Probably both.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Technology Timeline</h2><p>ARPANET—the internet's ancestor—went live in 1969. The first message ever sent between computers happened when Gen X was six months old. 'LOGIN,' from UCLA to Stanford. The system crashed after 'LO.' Technology has always been promising miracles and glitching on delivery. Gen X has seen this pattern repeat their entire life.</p><p>Childhood was analog in ways kids today can't comprehend. The rotary phone on the wall—Gen X could kill time just spinning the dial. The TV with five channels and no remote, requiring Gen X to physically walk across the room to change it. (This is why Gen X watched whatever was on.) The console stereo that weighed 200 pounds and played records parents owned.</p><p>Pong arrived when Gen X was three. Space Invaders when Gen X was nine. Pac-Man when Gen X was eleven, eating quarters at the arcade like feeding a slot machine. The Atari 2600 was the holy grail—if a family had one, that house was headquarters. Combat. Adventure. Pitfall. Graphics that were basically moving squares, but to Gen X, they were everything.</p><p>At eight, the Apple II dropped. At twelve, the IBM PC made computers safe for corporate America. At fifteen, Gen X might have seen their first Macintosh—'Hello, I'm Macintosh'—and understood that computers could be friendly, even if Gen X couldn't afford one. Gen X learned to type on actual typewriters, then adapted to word processors. Gen X bridges manual and digital.</p><p>Gen X was twenty-two when the World Wide Web went public. Twenty-five when the first web browser made it usable. Thirty when Google launched, making all previous search engines obsolete. Gen X learned to use the internet as an adult, which means Gen X remembers what research was like before: card catalogs, microfiche, asking librarians. Gen X can still function without Google. It's a superpower now.</p><p>Gen X was thirty-five when Facebook opened to the public. Thirty-eight when the iPhone dropped. Gen X adopted social media skeptically, and they were right to. Gen X has watched it corrode public discourse, shorten attention spans, and turn everyone into brands. Gen X uses it—they have to—but Gen X also remembers what it was like before everyone had a camera in their pocket and an audience for their opinions. Some days, Gen X misses the quiet.</p><p>Gen X built much of this technology. Gen Xers founded Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, and SpaceX. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin—Gen X's cohort. Gen X made the future, but Gen X also remembers the promises. The internet was supposed to democratize information and connect humanity. It did those things, while also making everything somehow worse. Gen X saw it coming. Nobody listened. They rarely do.</p>"

Parents watched on black-and-white televisions, tears streaming, while Gen X slept through humanity's greatest achievement. Parents would tell Gen X about it for the rest of their lives. Gen X was supposed to be living on Mars by now. Instead, Gen X got strip malls and streaming services.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At five, Gen X watched Nixon resign.</span> 'I am not a crook,' he said, which meant he was definitely a crook. Parents were glued to the Watergate hearings all summer. This was Gen X's first political memory: the President of the United States, lying, caught, humiliated, gone. Every scandal since has felt like a rerun. Gen X has never been surprised when authority fails. Gen X expected it.</p><p>At six, Saigon fell. The last helicopter lifted off the embassy roof while South Vietnamese allies clung to the landing gear. The war parents had argued about for a decade was over, and America had lost. The footage played on the evening news between dinner and dessert. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Gen X learned early that superpower status doesn't mean winning.</span></p><p>At ten, Americans were held hostage in Iran for <span class=\"stat-box\">444</span> days. At eleven, Reagan was shot—Gen X probably heard about it at school, everyone crowded around a radio or TV. At twelve, John Lennon was murdered outside his apartment. The Beatles were already ancient history to Gen X, but parents grieved like they'd lost a family member. Gen X didn't understand. Someday Gen X would.</p><p>At seventeen, Challenger's smoke trail spread across the Florida sky—the defining Gen X moment that shaped this generation's permanent skepticism of progress and institutions.</p><p>At twenty, the Berlin Wall fell. Gen X watched on TV as Germans took sledgehammers to concrete, as strangers hugged and cried, as the Cold War Gen X had grown up fearing ended not with missiles but with champagne. At twenty-two, the Soviet Union dissolved. History was supposed to be over. Capitalism won. We'd reached the end. It wasn't the end. It was halftime.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_911}}, Gen X was {{AGE_DESCRIPTOR_911}} when the towers fell on 9/11.</span> Maybe Gen X had a corner office by then. Maybe Gen X had kids in daycare. Gen X watched the second plane hit live, and Gen X knew before anyone said it: the world just broke. The forever wars that followed—Afghanistan, Iraq, the whole War on Terror—sent people younger than Gen X to die in places they'd never heard of. Gen X was too old to deploy, too young to lead. Stuck watching from the sidelines.</p><p>At thirty-nine, the financial system collapsed. Unlike the kids just graduating, Gen X had something to lose. Their 401(k)s cratered. Their home values plunged by <span class=\"stat-box\">40%</span>. Friends lost houses, jobs, marriages. Gen X had played by the rules, and the rules had changed while Gen X was playing. Another lesson: the floor can always fall out. Plan accordingly.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>The job market of 1987-1991 offered entry-level positions, though not easily. The '87 crash and early '90s recession meant 'jobs' became 'McJobs'—a term Douglas Coupland invented specifically to describe Gen X's career prospects. Low-wage, low-prestige work in the service economy became common.</p><p>Boomer parents told Gen X to work hard and get ahead, as if the rules that applied to them still applied. Boomers got hired at twenty-two, worked the same job for forty years, got pensions and gold watches. Gen X got temp agencies, no benefits, and the vague promise that maybe someday a permanent position would open up. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The old social contract—work hard, stay loyal, retire with a pension—was being shredded in real time.</span></p><p>Gen X invented 'slacking' not because they were lazy—they weren't—but because working hard didn't lead anywhere. The corporate ladder had rungs missing. Promotions went to people with connections. Loyalty was rewarded with layoffs the moment quarterly numbers dipped. Gen X learned fast: the company doesn't love anyone back. Never did. Never will. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Job security became an oxymoron.</span></p><p>Gen X stopped expecting loyalty. They job-hopped because it was the only way to get raises. They kept their resumes updated and their options open. Boomers called this disloyal. Gen X called it survival. The social contract between employer and employee had been shredded before Gen X arrived; Gen X just refused to pretend it was still intact.</p><p>The dot-com boom of the late '90s was Gen X's first real break. They were twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty—old enough to have skills, young enough to pivot. Some got stock options that made them rich. Most got experience that would matter later. Then the bubble burst in 2000, and Gen X learned: booms end. Timing is luck. Never count on paper wealth.</p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">At {{AGE_AT_2008_CRISIS}}, the 2008 financial crisis arrived.</span> By 2008, Gen X was mid-career. Mortgage, maybe kids, actual things to lose. The crash hit Gen X differently than it hit the kids just graduating—they had nothing, Gen X had something, and Gen X watched it evaporate. Their 401(k)s lost forty percent. Their houses were suddenly worth less than they paid. But Gen X had been through recessions before. They knew how to survive.</p><p>Now Gen X is in leadership. They manage differently than Boomers did—less micromanaging, more skepticism about corporate mission statements, more willingness to let people work from home and actually mean it. Gen X remembers being exploited. They try not to pass it on. Some succeed. Some become the very Boomers they swore they'd never be. It's a fine line.</p>"

When dates were planned days in advance because there was no way to text 'running 5 min late'? When Gen X sat by the phone—the one attached to the wall—waiting for it to ring, because that was Gen X's only option?</p><p>Gen X learned romance the old-fashioned way. Passing notes in class, folded into elaborate origami. Mix tapes with carefully sequenced songs that told a story if the recipient was paying attention. Slow dances at school where the DJ played 'Stairway to Heaven' and Gen X had eight minutes of legitimate hand-on-waist contact. The stakes felt enormous because there were no do-overs. Gen X couldn't screenshot anything. The moment was the moment.</p><p>The divorce rate peaked when Gen X were a kid—their parents' generation shattered the illusion that marriage was forever. Half Gen X's friends had divorced parents, alternating weekends, two Christmases. This shaped how Gen X approached relationships: cautiously, skeptically, with exit strategies considered. Gen X wanted love, but Gen X'd seen how badly it could end. Gen X kept one foot near the door.</p><p>Gen X delayed marriage compared to Gen X's parents. Some of it was economic—Gen X couldn't afford a wedding, let alone a house. Some of it was cultural—Gen X'd watched too many bad marriages implode. Gen X normalized living together first, which scandalized Gen X's parents but made perfect sense to Gen X. Why sign a contract before Gen X knew if Gen X could stand each other's morning breath?</p><p>Communication changed more in Gen X's lifetime than in any generation before. Landlines to cell phones to smartphones. Letters to email to texts to DMs. Gen X adapted to each platform, but Gen X remember what came before. Gen X remember being unreachable. Gen X remember making plans and keeping them because there was no other choice. Gen X remember the silence, and some days Gen X miss it desperately.</p><p>Gen X's friendships are smaller and deeper than the hundreds of 'friends' younger generations collect online. Gen X have people Gen X've known for forty years. People who remember Gen X before Gen X were who Gen X are now. People who saw Gen X fail and stuck around. That continuity matters more as Gen X age. It's not about quantity. It was never about quantity.</p><p>Social media arrived in Gen X's thirties, after Gen X's identity was formed. Gen X use it—Gen X have to—but it doesn't define Gen X. Gen X can put the phone down. Gen X can go hours without checking notifications. This isn't discipline; it's just how Gen X were raised. The dopamine machine didn't get Gen X young enough to fully hook Gen X.</p>"

Price controls. Rationing. The sense that the good times were over and nobody knew when they'd return. This shaped everything about how Gen X thinks about money.</p><p>Stagflation was the word. High inflation. High unemployment. Simultaneously. Economics professors said it wasn't supposed to be possible. The economy disagreed. Mortgage rates hit <span class=\"stat-box\">18%</span> in the early '80s. By the time Carter used the word 'malaise' in 1979, Gen X was ten and already understood that prosperity wasn't guaranteed. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The postwar boom parents took for granted was ancient history. Scarcity was the new normal.</span></p><p><span class=\"hero-callout\">Three major economic crashes hit during Gen X's prime earning years.</span> The early '90s—Gen X was entering the workforce, there were no jobs. The dot-com bust—Gen X had stock options that evaporated overnight. 2008—Gen X's houses were worth less than their mortgages. Each crash taught the same lesson: <span class=\"pull-quote\">economic security is an illusion. The floor can always fall out. Plan accordingly.</span></p><p>Gen X's relationship with money is pragmatic bordering on paranoid. Gen X doesn't trust windfalls. They're suspicious of get-rich-quick schemes. Gen X saves obsessively, invests conservatively, and still feels like it's not enough. The emergency fund parents never needed? Gen X has got six months' expenses tucked away, minimum. Because Gen X knows how fast things fall apart.</p><p>Housing was supposed to be the path to wealth, and for many Gen Xers, it worked—if they bought in the '90s before prices exploded. A starter home in 1995 that cost $120,000 might be worth $500,000 now. That's not investing skill; that's timing. Gen X was lucky. Gen X knows it. It doesn't make Gen X feel rich; it makes Gen X feel like they barely dodged something.</p><p>Gen X is sandwiched now. Aging parents who need care, maybe moving in, certainly needing money for assisted living or medical bills. Adult children who can't afford rent, let alone houses, boomeranging back to the basement Gen X converted into an apartment. Gen X is financially responsible for generations on either side while trying to fund a retirement that keeps receding into the distance.</p><p>The numbers say Gen X is better off than Millennials. The numbers are right—timing gave Gen X advantages Millennials didn't get. But 'better off' doesn't mean 'secure.' It means 'slightly less screwed.' Gen X has watched every promise get broken. Social Security might not exist when Gen X needs it. Pensions vanished decades ago. Gen X is on their own. Gen X has always been on their own.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Gen X's Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Gen X's self-reliance is a superpower and a curse. Gen X learned to figure things out alone because there was no other option. Latchkey kid, remember? But now Gen X don't ask for help even when help exists. Gen X suffer in silence, dismiss Gen X's own struggles, telling themselves to toughen up. Therapy? That's for people who can't handle their problems. (This is wrong. Go to therapy.)</p><p>Irony is Gen X's native language, and it's limiting Gen X. Gen X deflect sincerity with sarcasm. Gen X hedge everything with detachment. Caring about something openly feels dangerous—what if it fails? What if people mock Gen X? Better to stay cool, stay distant, stay safe behind layers of not-quite-meaning-it. This made Gen X interesting at twenty-two. At fifty-five, it's keeping Gen X from the depth Gen X actually want.</p><p>Gen X have a chip on Gen X's shoulder about being ignored. Stuck between Boomers and Millennials, Gen X've spent decades invisible to marketers, politicians, and trend pieces. This has made Gen X prickly about recognition, dismissive of generations that get attention, and sometimes bitter about doing the work while others get the credit. 'Whatever' became Gen X's catchphrase for a reason. But 'whatever' isn't a strategy. It's surrender.</p><p>The language around identity, gender, and race has evolved faster than some of Gen X have. Gen X's formative years were less diverse than what came after. Gen X're not bigots—mostly—but Gen X stumble over terminology that didn't exist when Gen X learned to talk about people. Pronouns feel complicated. Categories that seemed fixed are suddenly fluid. Learning feels harder than it should, and the patience for Gen X's learning curve is thin. This isn't about being bad. It's about being behind.</p><p>Gen X's cynicism, while often justified, becomes self-defeating. Gen X expect institutions to fail, so Gen X don't engage with them. Gen X expect politicians to disappoint, so Gen X don't vote. Gen X expect systems to be rigged, so Gen X don't try to fix them. The world needs changing, but Gen X is more likely to mock the problems than organize around solutions. Ironic detachment is not a political strategy.</p><p>Gen X're technologically capable but not always current. Gen X can use the internet—Gen X basically built it—but Gen X're often a platform or two behind. TikTok feels like too much. Discord seems unnecessary. Gen X're not unable; Gen X're choosing not to. But the cost is cultural: moments happen online that Gen X miss, references that pass Gen X by, a slow drift toward irrelevance that Gen X pretend doesn't bother Gen X. It does.</p><p>And maybe the deepest blind spot: Gen X've accepted less than Gen X deserved for so long that Gen X've forgotten Gen X deserved more. The McJobs, the stagnant wages, the broken promises—Gen X shrugged and adapted. Gen X stopped fighting because fighting felt pointless. But Gen X's acceptance became complicity. The system didn't just fail Gen X; Gen X let it fail the generations that came after. Gen X knew better. Gen X could have done more. Most of Gen X didn't.</p>"

The early '90s recession knocked Gen X around, but then came the boom. The internet. The stock market climbing. Clinton-era prosperity, or at least the appearance of it. Gen X's twenties were grunge and dot-coms, flannel shirts and IPOs. Gen X figured out who they were outside their parents' house. Some got married, started families. Others stayed loose, exploring. The '90s belonged to Gen X—old enough to participate, young enough to enjoy it.</p><p><strong>30s (1999-2009):</strong> The decade that broke everything. Gen X was thirty when Y2K turned out to be nothing. Gen X was thirty-two when 9/11 turned out to be everything. The towers fell. The wars started. The security state emerged. Gen X watched their country become paranoid, angry, fearful—and Gen X felt it too. Then came 2008: the crash, the bailouts, Gen X's houses worth less than their mortgages. Gen X had kids by then, responsibilities, things to lose. Gen X lost some of them. This decade aged Gen X in ways that don't show on the outside.</p><p><strong>40s (2009-2019):</strong> Recovery. Rebuilding. Middle age. Gen X focused on stability—keeping the job, maintaining the marriage, raising kids who seemed to need different things than Gen X had needed. Smartphones took over. Social media changed everything. Gen X adapted, but Gen X also resisted, suspicious of how much technology wanted to consume. Gen X hit peak earning years and still felt behind. Gen X was supposed to be established by now. Gen X was supposed to feel secure. Gen X didn't. Nobody told Gen X middle age would feel like this—tired but functional, accomplished but unfulfilled.</p><p><strong>50s (2019-2029):</strong> Gen X is here now. COVID hit when Gen X was fifty or fifty-one. Another crisis—Gen X has lost count of how many—but this one was different. Working from home. Kids boomeranging back. Parents in nursing homes Gen X couldn't visit. Gen X adapted, because adapting is what Gen X does. Gen X's kids are grown or nearly grown. Gen X's parents are aging, some already gone. Gen X is thinking about endings: retirement, legacy, what it all meant. The finish line is visible, but the path keeps shifting. Gen X is tired in ways they didn't expect. Gen X is also more comfortable in their skin than they've ever been. Turns out not caring what people think was always the goal. Gen X finally achieved it.</p><p><strong>60s and beyond (2029+):</strong> Retirement is the theory. The practice depends on math Gen X can't fully control: whether Gen X saved enough, whether Social Security survives, whether healthcare costs don't bankrupt Gen X, whether Gen X's kids need help, whether Gen X's body cooperates. The future isn't the space colony Gen X was promised at eight years old. It's messier, warmer, more uncertain. But Gen X has survived everything so far—stagflation, recessions, wars, crashes, a pandemic. Gen X will probably survive this too. That's the Gen X way: low expectations, consistent performance. It's not inspiring. It works.</p>"

Sandwiched between 76 million Boomers and 72 million Millennials, Gen X has spent their entire life being ignored. Marketers skip Gen X. Politicians overlook Gen X. Trend pieces forget Gen X exists. This is annoying, but it's also kind of freeing. Nobody expects anything from Gen X. They can just... do their thing.</p><p><strong>Compared to Boomers (born 1946-1964):</strong> Boomers got the postwar boom, cheap housing, pensions, and the confidence that comes from never being seriously challenged. Gen X got stagflation, Watergate, AIDS, and the end of every promise Boomers took for granted. Boomers went to Woodstock; Gen X inherited the hangover. Boomers got free love; Gen X got the epidemic that made love potentially fatal. Boomers built the systems that would fail Gen X. Boomers lecture Gen X about work ethic from houses that appreciated 400% while they slept.</p><p>But Gen X is more adaptable than Boomers ever had to be. Gen X has navigated recessions, technological revolutions, and social upheavals Boomers can't comprehend. Gen X learned to pivot because staying put wasn't an option. Boomers had safety nets; Gen X became their own.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> Millennials got screwed harder than Gen X did, and they know it. Gen X bought houses when houses were affordable. Gen X entered the job market before it became a hunger game. Gen X paid off student loans before they became life sentences. This makes Millennials resent Gen X, which is fair—timing gave Gen X advantages Millennials never had, even if Gen X didn't feel advantaged at the time. Millennials are louder than Gen X, more earnest, more willing to complain publicly. Gen X finds this exhausting. Millennials find Gen X's silence complicit. Both views have merit.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> Gen X is practically analog to Gen Z. Gen X remembers life before the internet, before smartphones, before every moment was documented and performed. Gen X can disconnect in ways Gen Z finds incomprehensible. Gen Z is anxious in ways Gen X finds confusing—surely having all the world's information everywhere should make things easier, not harder? Gen X is impressed by Gen Z's activism, bemused by their nihilism, and occasionally horrified by their TikTok dances. Gen X is old enough to be Gen Z's parents. Many are.</p><p>Gen X's life expectancy is 78-80 years. Gen X has got two, maybe three decades left, statistically. Gen X is healthier than previous generations at this age—less smoking, better medicine, more vegetables—but Gen X is also more stressed, more medicated, and more aware that climate change will make their final chapters interesting in ways they'd rather avoid.</p><p>Gen X's legacy might be pragmatism. Gen X didn't change the world like Boomers claimed to. Gen X didn't break the internet like Millennials did. Gen X just showed up, did the work, expected nothing, and were pleasantly surprised when things occasionally worked out. That's not inspirational. It's not a TED Talk. It's survival, and survival counts for more than people give it credit for.</p>"
