      "html": "<h2>Childhood: 1959-1971</h2><p>The smell of your grandmother's kitchen—Crisco in a cast-iron skillet, Maxwell House percolating on the counter, Wonder Bread in the breadbox. The crackle of the transistor radio playing 'Venus' by Frankie Avalon. The satisfying click of Lincoln Logs snapping together. Your childhood had a weight to it that children today will never understand—everything was built to last, because throwing things away was still considered wasteful.</p><p>On March 9, 1959, three months before you were born, a plastic doll named Barbie debuted at the American Toy Fair in New York. She cost $3. By your fifth birthday, she'd be everywhere—Barbie Dream Houses, Barbie clothes, Barbie as a cultural argument about what girls should aspire to be. You grew up alongside her, though whether she shaped you or you shaped her is a question nobody's quite settled.</p><p>At four, you watched your parents cry in front of the television. JFK was dead in Dallas, and Walter Cronkite took off his glasses to tell you. You didn't understand it—you were four—but you understood that something terrible had happened, that the world had broken in some way the adults couldn't explain. Five years later, Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were both gunned down within two months. By the time you were nine, you'd absorbed the lesson that America killed its dreamers.</p><p>Your Saturday mornings belonged to Rocky and Bullwinkle, with their jokes you wouldn't understand for another decade. The Flintstones on Friday nights—a cartoon for grown-ups that kids watched anyway. Sunday evenings meant The Wonderful World of Disney and the peacock spreading its feathers on NBC (if you were lucky enough to have a color set). You watched The Twilight Zone when your parents let you, scared and thrilled in equal measure, Rod Serling's cigarette smoke curling through dimensions unknown.</p><p>You built model rockets and slot car tracks. You collected baseball cards and stuck them in your bicycle spokes. You played Kick the Can until the streetlights came on. You ate Swanson TV dinners on folding trays, the aluminum compartments keeping your Salisbury steak separate from your mashed potatoes. Tang sat in the cabinet—the drink the astronauts drank, orange powder that made you part of the space age. You were ten years old when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, and you watched it live, in your living room, believing anything was possible.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Your Generation: Baby Boomers</h2><p>Baby Boomer. The label was coined by a newspaper columnist in 1963, when you were four years old, to describe the demographic explosion that followed World War II. Eighteen million GIs came home, started families, and your generation—76 million strong—was the result. You're the largest generation in American history, at least until Millennials eventually edged past you. You've dominated every decade you've lived through by sheer force of numbers.</p><p>Born in 1959, you're what demographers call a 'Late Boomer' or 'Generation Jones'—named for the jones, the longing, for the opportunities your older siblings seemed to have. You weren't at Woodstock—you were ten years old in August 1969, probably watching the news coverage with a mix of fascination and confusion. You didn't burn your draft card because the draft ended when you were fourteen. You inherited the counterculture second-hand: the music, the fashion, the attitude, but not the tear gas at the '68 Democratic Convention.</p><p>The narrative of your generation is one of unprecedented opportunity. College cost a few hundred dollars a semester. Your parents could buy a house on a single middle-class salary. Pensions were standard. The American Dream wasn't a slogan—it was a floor plan in the suburbs, a station wagon in the driveway, a future that felt assured. But timing within the Boom matters enormously. Early Boomers caught the upswing. You caught the stagflation of the late '70s, the oil crisis lines stretching around the block, the recession of the early '80s.</p><p>Your generation gets blamed for pulling the ladder up behind you. For defunding public universities after you graduated from them. For voting for tax cuts that starved the programs that built you. For treating housing as investment rather than shelter. Whether that's fair criticism or generational scapegoating depends on the day and who's doing the math. What's undeniable is that the path you walked has been paved over, and pointing to it as if it's still there doesn't help your children, who are still renting in their forties.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Pop Culture Touchstones</h2><p>February 3, 1959. Four months before you were born, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper died in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa. Don McLean would later call it 'the day the music died,' but rock and roll was just getting started. Elvis was in the Army, stationed in Germany. Berry Gordy was about to found Motown Records in a Detroit house he called Hitsville USA. The music that would define your childhood was being born alongside you.</p><p>Ben-Hur swept the Oscars your birth year—eleven wins, a record that would stand for decades. Bonanza premiered on NBC, launching the golden age of TV westerns. The Twilight Zone debuted on CBS, Rod Serling inviting America into dimensions of imagination. These weren't your shows yet—you were a baby—but they'd be in syndication throughout your childhood, absorbed through endless reruns.</p><p>At five, you watched the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. February 9, 1964. Seventy-three million Americans tuned in. Your parents didn't understand why the girls were screaming. You might not have either, but you understood something was happening. The British Invasion had landed. By the time you were seven, you knew every word to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'She Loves You.' By ten, you were ready for Sgt. Pepper's.</p><p>Your teenage years coincided with rock's greatest evolution. At twelve, Led Zeppelin released their debut album. At thirteen, you heard 'Stairway to Heaven' for the first time. At fourteen, Dark Side of the Moon. You bought vinyl at the record store—actual records, with gatefold covers you studied like sacred texts. You argued about whether the Stones were better than the Beatles, whether Zeppelin was heavier than Sabbath, whether Hendrix was from this planet at all.</p><p>Television meant Gilligan's Island, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Bewitched. It meant laughing at Gomer Pyle and learning about space from Star Trek. It meant watching Vietnam on the evening news, body counts delivered between commercials for Chevrolet. By the time M*A*S*H premiered when you were thirteen, the irony of a show about Korea that was really about Vietnam wasn't lost on you.</p><p>At seventeen, you watched Saturday Night Live's first episode—'Live from New York!' At twenty, you survived the disco era (Saturday Night Fever, the Bee Gees, platform shoes you'd later deny owning). At twenty-two, MTV launched with 'Video Killed the Radio Star.' You were young enough to understand it, old enough to remember when music was something you listened to rather than watched.</p>"

    "technology": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Technology Timeline</h2><p>The year you were born, Jack Kilby demonstrated the first integrated circuit at Texas Instruments—a tiny chip that would eventually put more computing power in your pocket than existed on the entire planet in 1959. But that was decades away. In your childhood, 'computer' meant a room-sized machine fed by punch cards, operated by men in white lab coats at IBM and Bell Labs. Science fiction, not daily life.</p><p>Your first television was black-and-white, probably a console that sat in the living room like furniture. You remember when your family got their first color set—maybe 1965, maybe later—and how strange The Wonderful World of Disney looked when the peacock actually had colors. The test pattern at the end of the broadcast day. The satisfying clunk of the rotary channel dial. Rabbit ears that needed constant adjustment.</p><p>At ten, you watched men walk on the moon. July 20, 1969. The grainy footage, Armstrong's crackly voice, the impossible made real in your living room. Technology had delivered on its promise. The future was arriving on schedule. You believed, in a way your grandchildren never quite will, that progress was linear and inevitable.</p><p>At sixteen, the Altair 8800 appeared—the first personal computer for hobbyists, sold as a kit for $439. You probably didn't notice. At twenty, the Apple II brought home computing to actual humans who didn't speak assembly language. At twenty-two, IBM released its PC, and suddenly offices had screens on every desk. You were young enough to adapt, old enough to remember when typewriters were state of the art.</p><p>You were thirty-five when the World Wide Web went public. Dial-up modems that screamed like fax machines. AOL CDs in every mailbox. 'You've Got Mail' as a cultural event. Email felt revolutionary—instant communication across oceans! By forty, you'd learned to search on Google. By forty-eight, Facebook existed. By fifty, you held an iPhone and the entire sum of human knowledge fit in your palm.</p><p>You've watched technology advance more in your lifetime than in all previous human history combined. You've kept pace, more or less. But your relationship with it remains practical rather than native. You can still read a paper map, balance a checkbook by hand, remember phone numbers without a contact list. These skills feel increasingly quaint, but they work when the power goes out.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Historical Milestones</h2><p>Where were you when Kennedy was shot? You were four years old. November 22, 1963. Dallas. You might have a hazy memory—disrupted television, grown-ups crying, a feeling that the world had cracked. Or you might remember nothing, just the aftermath: the funeral procession, John-John saluting, a black veil on Jackie Kennedy. Your first lesson in how quickly everything can change.</p><p>You were three during the Cuban Missile Crisis—October 1962, thirteen days when nuclear annihilation felt imminent. You don't remember it, but the adults around you did. The fallout shelter signs, the duck-and-cover drills, the maps showing missile range circles centered on your city. The Cold War wasn't abstract for your parents. It was existential. You grew up in the shadow of the mushroom cloud.</p><p>At nine, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. Two months later, Bobby Kennedy was shot in a Los Angeles hotel kitchen. You were old enough now to understand. Old enough to watch the funeral trains on television. Old enough to absorb the lesson that America killed its dreamers. At ten, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon—the promise kept, proof that the future was real. Six months later, Altamont ended the Summer of Love's fantasy with a stabbing caught on film. The sixties gave you whiplash.</p><p>Vietnam was background noise throughout your childhood—body counts on the evening news, protests on college campuses your older siblings might have attended. You were sixteen when Saigon fell. April 30, 1975. Helicopters on embassy rooftops, desperate evacuations, the longest war in American history ending not with victory but with humiliation. Your generation's older brothers came home changed, or didn't come home at all.</p><p>Watergate unfolded during your high school years. You watched a president lie on national television, then resign in disgrace. 'I am not a crook' became a punchline. At fifteen, you'd learned that authority figures lied, that institutions were corrupt, that the system would protect itself before it protected you. This was your political education.</p><p>At thirty, the Berlin Wall fell—November 1989, crowds with sledgehammers, champagne in the streets. The Cold War that had defined your entire life simply ended. At forty-two, you watched the Twin Towers fall on live television, and a different kind of war began. At forty-nine, the financial system collapsed, retirement accounts evaporating, banks too big to fail failing anyway. History hasn't stopped. It's just started moving faster than you can process.</p>"

    "career": {
      "html": "<h2>Career & Professional Life</h2><p>You graduated college around 1981—right into a recession. Unemployment hit 10.8% in late 1982, the highest since the Great Depression. The post-war boom your older siblings rode was over. Stagflation—that impossible combination of high unemployment and high inflation—had rewritten the rules. Gas lines stretched around blocks. Interest rates hit 20%. The easy jobs your cousins found in 1970 had evaporated by the time you went looking.</p><p>Your generation invented careerism as a lifestyle. You read 'Dress for Success' and bought the power suits. You networked before networking was a verb. You understood that the organization man was dead—killed by layoffs, downsizing, the first wave of 'restructuring' that would become a permanent condition. You were supposed to be your own brand, chart your own path. Which really meant you were on your own when things went wrong.</p><p>The deal changed while you were mid-career. You started with the expectation of a pension—defined benefit, employer-funded, retirement as a promise. By the late '80s, 401(k)s had replaced them—defined contribution, employee-funded, retirement as a gamble. The risk shifted from corporations to you, dressed up as 'flexibility' and 'control.' You adapted because you had to. Your kids never had the pension option at all.</p><p>If you're a woman, your career arc was complicated by expectations your daughters can barely imagine. The glass ceiling wasn't a metaphor—it was policy, culture, law. You were told you could have it all: career, family, fulfillment. What they meant was you could do it all, perfectly, while being paid less and promoted slower. Whatever you achieved, you achieved against headwinds the official narrative pretended didn't exist. Sandra Day O'Connor joined the Supreme Court when you were twenty-two. Progress was possible. It was just exhausting.</p><p>You've probably retired by now, or you're close. Social Security is real for you—you'll actually collect it, unlike your children who view it as a theoretical construct that might not survive their lifetimes. Medicare will cover your healthcare. If you're lucky, you have a paid-off house that appreciated 400% while you weren't looking. Your generation got the last reliable version of American retirement. The ladder you climbed has been pulled up behind you, not because you pulled it, but because the system stopped building ladders.</p>"

    "relationships": {
      "html": "<h2>Relationships & Communication</h2><p>Remember when getting someone's phone number meant actually calling their house? Rotary dial, wait for the connection, hope their father didn't answer. The courage required to make that call—sitting in the kitchen where everyone could hear, stretching the cord as far as it would reach for the illusion of privacy. There was no texting, no DMs, no way to communicate that didn't involve your voice and immediate vulnerability.</p><p>You came of age during the sexual revolution, which sounds more liberating than it often was. The Pill became widely available when you were a teenager. Premarital sex stopped being automatically scandalous. But nobody quite knew what the new rules were—your parents' courtship scripts were obsolete, and nothing had replaced them yet. You made it up as you went along, which was exciting and terrifying in roughly equal measure.</p><p>You probably married younger than your children will—mid-twenties was standard, late twenties raised eyebrows. Divorce rates peaked in the 1980s, when you were in your twenties; your generation normalized ending marriages that didn't work, which horrified your parents and liberated you. Whether you're on your first spouse or your third, you're part of a pattern your generation created: the belief that personal fulfillment matters more than institutional obligation.</p><p>Your friendships were built in person—neighbors, coworkers, the parents of your children's friends. You remember people's birthdays without Facebook reminders. You have phone numbers memorized from the 1970s. You stayed in touch with Christmas cards and occasional long-distance calls that cost real money by the minute. The people you've known for forty years know you in ways that two hundred Instagram followers never will.</p><p>Your children communicate in ways that feel alien. They text instead of calling. They have 'friends' they've never met. They share intimate details with strangers on the internet and call you once a month if you're lucky. You worry about them, and they think you don't understand. Both of you are right. The chasm between how you built relationships and how they build theirs is wider than technology—it's a different understanding of what connection means.</p>"

    "financial": {
      "html": "<h2>Financial Psychology</h2><p>Your parents survived the Great Depression. They saved string, reused aluminum foil, distrusted banks with a wariness born of watching them fail. You inherited some of that caution—you remember the lectures about waste, the insistence on finishing everything on your plate—but prosperity made it feel obsolete. Credit cards arrived. Mortgages were cheap. The stock market only went up. Why hoard when abundance felt permanent?</p><p>The numbers tell the story of your timing. In 1985, when you were twenty-six, the median home price was about $75,000—roughly three times the median income. A house was something you bought in your twenties, not something you dreamed about in your forties. You bought one. It appreciated 400% while you slept. The wealth you accumulated wasn't because you were smarter than your children. It was because you were earlier.</p><p>College cost you maybe $2,000 a year in tuition—a summer job could cover it. Your children graduated with $30,000 in debt, your grandchildren with twice that. You worked your way through school because working your way through school was mathematically possible. That equation no longer balances. Telling them to 'just work harder' reveals how much the ground has shifted.</p><p>You've watched the market boom and crash, boom and crash. Black Monday in 1987—you were twenty-eight, watching the Dow drop 22% in a single day. The dot-com bubble when you were forty-one. The 2008 collapse when you were forty-nine, retirement accounts evaporating just as you were starting to count on them. Each time, you were told the fundamentals were sound. Each time, they weren't. You learned that the market is a casino with better PR, but you kept playing because mattresses don't compound.</p><p>Your generation holds more than half of America's wealth. Millennials, at the same age, hold 7%. Some of that gap is fair—you've had longer to accumulate. But some of it reflects structural advantages that have been systematically dismantled: affordable education, defined-benefit pensions, housing that cost less than a decade of rent, wages that rose with productivity. You caught the last train. The station closed behind you.</p>"

    "blind_spots": {
      "html": "<h2>Your Generational Blind Spots</h2><p>Here's the thing nobody wants to say: you believe your success was entirely earned. It was partly earned—you worked hard, made sacrifices, showed up when showing up mattered. But it was also partly structural. You came of age when unions were strong, when college cost a summer job, when one income could support a family of four in a house with a yard. Those conditions weren't your achievement. They were your context. And they're gone.</p><p>'Just walk in and ask for the manager.' 'Pound the pavement.' 'A firm handshake and eye contact.' This is the advice you give, because it's what worked for you. But it describes a world that no longer exists. Resumes go into digital voids. Algorithms screen candidates before humans see them. Entry-level positions require three years of experience. The path you walked has been paved over, and pointing to it as if it's still there—as if your grandchildren are just too lazy to find it—doesn't help anyone. It just makes them stop calling.</p><p>Your relationship with technology often slides from skepticism into dismissal. You didn't grow up online, so online life can feel trivial—all that sharing, all that posting, all that performing for strangers. But for younger generations, the internet is where careers happen, where movements organize, where identity gets negotiated in real time. Dismissing it as 'not real life' dismisses them. And they notice.</p><p>You were raised to believe in institutions—government, corporations, the church, marriage—that have since proven less trustworthy than advertised. Your instinct is to reform them, to work within the system, to trust that incremental change will eventually deliver justice. Younger generations, having watched those institutions fail repeatedly, are more inclined to burn it all down and build something new. Both approaches have merit. Neither has a monopoly on wisdom. But the urgency gap between you is real, and it's growing.</p><p>The hardest blind spot: the planet. Your generation got Earth at a particular moment—post-war abundance, cheap energy, seemingly infinite growth. The environmental costs were hidden or deferred. Climate change is happening now, with consequences your grandchildren will pay. You didn't cause it alone, but you benefited from the system that caused it, and you voted for leaders who denied it was happening while the evidence piled up. This isn't entirely your fault. But pretending it's not partially your responsibility doesn't hold up anymore.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Life Phase Roadmap</h2><p><strong>Your 20s (1979-1989):</strong> You entered adulthood during economic turbulence—gas lines, stagflation, the worst recession since the Depression. Interest rates hit 20%. The easy paths your older cousins found were crowded or closed. Reagan promised morning in America, but the sun rose unevenly. You hustled, networked, bought the power suits. You probably got married in this decade—mid-twenties was standard. You definitely bought a house, because houses were still affordable on a middle-class salary. This was the decade where you laid the foundation for everything that came after.</p><p><strong>Your 30s (1989-1999):</strong> The Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War that had defined your entire life simply ended, and suddenly the future felt wide open. The economy boomed—dot-com money flowing, tech stocks soaring, irrational exuberance everywhere. You advanced in your career, reached middle management or better, watched your house appreciate faster than your salary. Your kids were in school. Your parents were still healthy. This was the sweet spot: old enough to have authority, young enough to have energy. The '90s felt like they might last forever.</p><p><strong>Your 40s (1999-2009):</strong> Y2K was a fizzle. September 11 was not. You were forty-two when the towers fell, old enough to understand the world had shifted, to feel the whiplash of 'before' and 'after' for the second time in your life. The Iraq War. The housing bubble inflating, then exploding. The financial crisis that nearly collapsed the global economy when you were forty-nine—retirement accounts evaporating just as you were starting to count on them. Your kids became teenagers, then adults. Your parents started needing help. The future felt less certain than it had a decade earlier.</p><p><strong>Your 50s (2009-2019):</strong> Recovery, slow and uneven. You helped your kids through college, paid tuition that had tripled since you attended, watched them graduate into a job market that treated them like expendable labor. Your parents needed more help, then passed away—the generation that survived the Depression and won the war, gone. The sandwich generation squeeze was real: responsibilities on both ends, support for neither. You started thinking seriously about retirement, about legacy, about what kind of world you were leaving behind.</p><p><strong>Your 60s (2019-2029):</strong> You're in this decade now. COVID reshaped your final working years or early retirement—remote work, isolation, the strange gift of time to think about what matters. Grandchildren, if you have them, are growing up in a world you barely recognize: climate anxiety, school shooting drills, politics as tribal warfare. You're trying to stay relevant while accepting that relevance might not be the point anymore. Your health is the variable that determines everything else.</p><p><strong>Your 70s and beyond (2029+):</strong> The actuarial tables give you another decade of good years, maybe more with luck and medicine. Healthcare will be your largest expense. Mobility, cognition, independence—these will narrow, gradually or suddenly. You'll tell stories about the world before the internet, before smartphones, before everything was connected and surveilled. Whether anyone listens depends on relationships you built decades ago. The finish line is visible now. What you leave behind—money, memories, lessons—is largely determined. What remains is how you spend what's left.</p>"

      "html": "<h2>Generational Comparison</h2><p>4.2 million people were born in America the same year as you. You're part of the 76 million Baby Boomers—the largest generation in American history for most of your lifetime, until Millennials eventually edged past you. You've dominated every decade you've lived through by sheer demographic weight: the economy, politics, culture, all of it shaped by your numbers.</p><p><strong>Compared to the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):</strong> They came of age during Depression and war, learned to keep their heads down, follow rules, build quietly. You came of age during abundance and questioned everything. They trusted institutions because institutions had saved them. You distrusted institutions because you'd seen them lie about Vietnam, Watergate, everything. They saved; you spent. They were grateful for stability; you demanded authenticity. The stereotypes flatten the reality, but the arc is clear: they built the system, you inherited it, and you're leaving it different than you found it.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen X (born 1965-1980):</strong> The forgotten middle child, squeezed between your demographic dominance and the Millennial surge that followed. They grew up as latchkey kids, raising themselves while you climbed corporate ladders. They're cynical in ways you find tiresome, realistic in ways you find defeatist. They got the leftovers of the prosperity you enjoyed—the jobs you didn't take, the housing market after you'd bought in. They expect less because they received less. They haven't forgiven you for it, and they're not entirely wrong.</p><p><strong>Compared to Millennials (born 1981-1996):</strong> The contrast is almost absurd. You bought houses in your twenties; they're renting in their forties. You had pensions; they have student loans. You graduated into opportunity; they graduated into the Great Recession. The generational wealth gap is the widest in American history: you control over half the nation's wealth, they control 7%. They're not bitter so much as exhausted. The system that worked for you broke before they could use it, and they've spent their adult lives being blamed for not making it work anyway.</p><p><strong>Compared to Gen Z (born 1997-2012):</strong> You're from different planets. They've never known a world without smartphones, without school shooting drills, without climate crisis as background radiation. They're anxious in ways that seem excessive until you remember what they've absorbed since childhood. They don't expect Social Security to exist when they're sixty-five. They don't expect the planet to be habitable when they're your age. They might be right about both.</p><p>Your life expectancy at birth was about 70 years. Modern medicine extended that—you can reasonably expect 80, maybe longer with luck and good genes. You've outlived more assumptions than any generation before you. The world you were born into—rotary phones, black-and-white TV, segregated lunch counters, the Soviet threat—has vanished. The world you'll leave behind—AI, climate emergency, smartphones in every pocket—is unrecognizable. That's the Boomer experience: everything changed, including you.</p>"
